export const REDDIT_COMMENT_PROMPT = `Help me craft authentic Reddit comments to promote my Actor.

Context:
- Actor name: [YOUR ACTOR NAME]
- What it does: [DESCRIPTION]
- Thread topic: [REDDIT THREAD TITLE/TOPIC]

Create 2-3 comment variations that:
- Start by genuinely addressing the thread question/topic
- Naturally mention my Actor as a solution
- Don't sound promotional or salesy
- Add real value to the conversation
- Are 50-150 words each
- Use casual Reddit tone (not corporate)
- Include a brief personal experience or insight

Each comment should feel like it's from a developer who happens to have built something relevant, not from someone trying to sell.`;
