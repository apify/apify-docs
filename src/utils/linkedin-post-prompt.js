export const LINKEDIN_POST_PROMPT = `Create 5 engaging LinkedIn posts to promote my Apify Actor, each with a different angle and hook. Each post should include a demo video concept.

Actor details:
- Actor name: [YOUR ACTOR NAME]
- Actor URL: [YOUR APIFY STORE URL]
- What it does: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION]
- Main business benefit: [KEY VALUE PROPOSITION - time saved, efficiency gained, etc.]
- Target audience: [WHO USES THIS - sales teams, marketers, researchers, etc.]
- Typical time savings: [HOW MUCH TIME IT SAVES vs. MANUAL APPROACH]

For each post, create:
1. An opening hook (1-2 punchy sentences that stop the scroll)
2. The problem description (2-3 sentences about the manual pain)
3. The solution introduction (2-3 sentences about your Actor)
4. Results/impact (2-3 sentences with specific metrics - numbers are key here)
5. Call-to-action question (engaging, encourages comments)
6. 3-5 relevant hashtags
7. Demo video concept (what to show in 30-90 seconds)

Post variation angles:

Post #1: "Before/After" Transformation
- Focus on the dramatic change in workflow
- Emphasize time saved with specific numbers
- Personal story angle: "I used to... now I..."
- Hook example: "I spent 6 hours doing [task] manually yesterday. Today? 8 minutes."

Post #2: "Problem/Agitation/Solution"
- Start with a frustrating problem everyone relates to
- Agitate the pain point (cost, frustration, wasted time)
- Present your Actor as the solution
- Hook example: "Your team is wasting 10+ hours per week on [task]. Here's what it's actually costing you..."

Post #3: "Behind-the-scenes/Building in public"
- Share why you built this Actor
- The problem you personally faced
- Invite others who have the same problem
- Hook example: "I built [Actor] because I was tired of [problem]. Turns out, I'm not alone."

Post #4: "Results/Case study"
- Lead with impressive results or metrics
- Show business impact
- Make it about ROI and efficiency
- Hook example: "Saved 15 hours last week using automation. Here's exactly how ⬇️"

Post #5: "Contrarian/Hot take"
- Challenge conventional wisdom about the task
- Position your Actor as the smarter approach
- Hook example: "Stop doing [task] manually. It's 2025. Here's the better way:"

Writing guidelines:
- Write in the first person for authenticity
- Use short paragraphs (1-3 sentences each)
- Be conversational and professional, not salesy
- Include specific numbers and metrics
- Focus on business outcomes, not technical features
- Use line breaks for readability
- Keep the total post under 1,300 characters for optimal engagement
- Make the hook compelling enough to stop mid-scroll

Professional tone:
- Confident but not arrogant
- Helpful, not pushy
- Data-driven, not vague
- Relatable, not corporate-speak
- Examples:
  Instead of: "This tool is amazing!" → "This approach cut my research time by 75%"
  Instead of: "Try my Actor!" → "Here's how I automated [task]:"
  Instead of: "It's super easy!" → "The setup takes less than 10 minutes"

Call-to-action variations:
- "What manual tasks are eating up your team's time?"
- "How are you currently handling [this process]?"
- "Anyone else spending too much time on [task]?"
- "What would you do with an extra 10 hours per week?"
- "Is your team still doing this manually?"

Hashtag strategy:
Mix these types (3-5 per post):
- Industry-specific: #SaaS #MarketResearch #SalesOps
- Outcome-focused: #Productivity #Efficiency #Automation
- Broad professional: #BusinessGrowth #ProfessionalDevelopment
- Tool/platform: #NoCode #DataAnalysis #WebScraping

Demo video concepts:
- Post #1: Split-screen showing manual process vs. automated
- Post #2: Screen recording of results with on-screen metrics
- Post #3: Quick walkthrough of the Actor in action
- Post #4: Dashboard showing time/cost savings
- Post #5: Side-by-side comparison of old way vs. new way

Video-specific notes:
- First 3 seconds must be compelling (show end result immediately)
- Add text overlays with key metrics/benefits
- Include captions (most LinkedIn videos watched without sound)
- End with clear next step or URL
- Keep it professional but authentic

Additional elements for each post:
- Suggest optimal posting time (e.g., "Tuesday 9 AM" or "Thursday lunch")
- Note whether to tag anyone relevant (but only if genuinely relevant)
- First comment suggestion (where to put the Actor link)
- Engagement strategy (how to respond to comments)
