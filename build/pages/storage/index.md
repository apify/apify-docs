# Storage

The Apify platform contains three storage types that you can use in your actors and also outside the Apify platform using HTTP API and JavaScript client.

Key-value store - simple storage for strings and files
Dataset - storage for sequential data objects (results)
[Request queue](/storage/request-queue) - dynamic queue of URLs to be processed
