# File Organization Rules

## Naming conventions

- Use **kebab-case** for file names: `web-scraping-basics.md`
- Use **descriptive names** that reflect content
- Group related files in **logical directories**

## Directory structure

```text
sources/
├── platform/          # Platform documentation
│   ├── actors/        # Actor-related content
│   ├── storage/       # Storage documentation
│   └── integrations/  # Integration guides
└── academy/           # Educational content
    ├── tutorials/     # Step-by-step guides
    ├── webscraping/   # Web scraping courses
    └── glossary/      # Terminology and definitions
```
