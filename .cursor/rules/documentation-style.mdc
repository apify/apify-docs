# Documentation Style Guidelines

## Project overview

This is the Apify documentation repository containing platform documentation, academy content, and API reference. The project uses Docusaurus with MDX, OpenAPI specifications, and follows Microsoft style guide principles.

## Documentation structure

- **Platform docs**: `/sources/platform/` - Core platform features and functionality
- **Academy**: `/sources/academy/` - Educational content, tutorials, and courses
- **API reference**: `/apify-api/` - Generated from OpenAPI specifications

## Writing style & guidelines

### Language & tone

- Use **US English** spelling and grammar
- Write in **inclusive language** - avoid gendered terms and assumptions
- Use **active voice** whenever possible
- Write for a **technical audience** but keep explanations clear and accessible
- Avoid directional language (don't use "left/right")
- Be **action-oriented** in descriptions and titles

### Technical writing best practices

- **Start with the user's goal** - what are they trying to accomplish?
- **Use clear, concise sentences** - avoid unnecessary complexity
- **Provide context** before diving into technical details
- **Use consistent terminology** throughout the documentation
- **Include examples** for complex concepts
- **Structure content logically** - from basic to advanced concepts

### Microsoft style guide compliance

- Use **sentence case** for headings (except main titles)
- Use **title case** for UI elements and proper nouns
- **Bold** for UI elements, buttons, menu items
- _Italics_ for emphasis and new terms
- `code` for inline code, file names, and technical terms
- Use **numbered lists** for sequential steps
- Use **bullet points** for non-sequential items

## Common patterns

### Tutorial structure

1. **Introduction** - What will the user learn?
2. **Prerequisites** - What do they need to know/have?
3. **Step-by-step instructions** - Clear, numbered steps
4. **Code examples** - Complete, working examples
5. **Summary** - What they accomplished and next steps

### Troubleshooting sections

- **Common issues** and solutions
- **Error messages** and their meanings
- **Debugging steps** for complex problems
- **Contact information** for additional help

## Accessibility guidelines

- Use **descriptive link text** (avoid "click here")
- Include **alt text** for all images
- Use **proper heading hierarchy** (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Write **clear, concise content**

## SEO best practices

- Use **descriptive page titles**
- Include **relevant keywords** naturally
- Write **meta descriptions** (140-160 characters)
- Use **proper heading structure**
- Include **internal links** to related content

Remember: The goal is to help users succeed with Apify. Every piece of documentation should serve that purpose by being clear, accurate, and actionable.
