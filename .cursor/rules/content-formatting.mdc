# Content Formatting Rules

## Front matter (MDX files)

```yaml
---
title: "Clear, action-oriented title"
description: "140-160 character description that explains the value"
sidebar_position: 1
slug: /path/to/page
---
```

## Text emphasis

- **Bold** for UI elements, buttons, menu items
- *Italics* for emphasis and new terms
- `code` for inline code, file names, paths, variables
- Use code blocks with language specification for examples

## Admonitions

Use admonitions to highlight important information:

```markdown
:::note Important information
Your note content here.
:::

:::tip Pro tip
Helpful tip for users.
:::

:::info Additional context
Background information.
:::

:::caution Warning
Something to be careful about.
:::

:::danger Critical
Critical information that could cause issues.
:::
```

## Code examples

- Use **code tabs** for multiple language examples
- Include **complete, runnable examples**
- Add **comments** to explain complex code
- Use **syntax highlighting** for all code blocks
