You can navigate through the months by selecting from a dropdown list or using arrows to move one month backward or forward.\n\nThe tab features an adjustable bar chart. This chart can be customized to display statistics either on a monthly or daily basis. Additionally, you can view these statistics as absolute or cumulative numbers, providing flexibility in how you analyze your usage data.\n\n:::info Monthly usage data\nSince billing cycles can shift, the data in the **Historical usage** tab is shown for calendar months.\n:::\n\n![Apify Console historical usage view](./images/console-billing-historical-usage.png)\n\nBelow the bar chart, there is a table titled **Usage by Actors**.
