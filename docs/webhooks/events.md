# [](./webhooks#events)Events

An event is represented by a **type** and related **data**. The type is a `string` that shows the event's name and its hierarchy in the tree of available events, e.g.: `ACTOR.RUN.SUCCEEDED`. The data are an `Object` with variable properties. See documentation of individual events for examples of data.

**Currently, webhooks are only available for actor run events, with new types in the pipeline.**

## [](./webhooks#events-actor-run)Actor run

Actor run events are triggered when an actor run gets created or transitions into a new state. Webhook can be defined for all runs of an [actor]({{@link actor.md}}) at its detail page or for a specific [actor task]({{@link tasks.md}}) at its detail page. In that case, the webhook is invoked only for runs started for that task.

### Event types:

*   `ACTOR.RUN.CREATED` - New actor run has been created.
*   `ACTOR.RUN.SUCCEEDED` - Actor run finished with status `SUCCEEDED`
*   `ACTOR.RUN.FAILED` - Actor run finished with status `FAILED`
*   `ACTOR.RUN.ABORTED` - Actor run finished with status `ABORTED`
*   `ACTOR.RUN.TIMED_OUT` - Actor run finished with status `TIMED-OUT`

### Event data:

    {
        "actorId": "ID of the triggering actor.",
        "actorTaskId": "If task was used, its ID.",
        "actorRunId": "Id of the triggering actor run.",
    }
