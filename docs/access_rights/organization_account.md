<!-- Taken from GitHub - rephrase, customize, don't plagiarize -->
|**Warning:** when you convert an existing user account into an organization, |
|---|
|You will no longer be able to sign in to the converted user account.|
|You will no longer be able to create or modify gists owned by the converted user account.|
|An organization cannot be converted back to a user.|
|The SSH keys, OAuth tokens, job profile, reactions, and associated user information, will not be transferred to the organization. This is only true for the user account that's being converted, not any of the user account's collaborators.|
|Any commits made with the converted user account will no longer be linked to that account. The commits themselves will remain intact.|
