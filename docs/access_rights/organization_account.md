# Organization account

Apify's organization account allows teams to manage permissions and work as one organization. Manage team members, invite new members, etc.

If you already have all your code in the user account and you convert it to organization, you can keep using your integrations and everything will be fine.

If you make a new account for the organization and then move the projects over to it from your personal account, the integrations/linking/everything will need to be updated.

So, if you're gonna start a brand new codebase, it's best to create a new account. If you already have everything in place and want to manage your team's permissions, etc, it's best to convert your account to organization.

> * You will no longer be able to sign in to the converted user account.
> * An organization cannot be converted back to a user.
> * All of your integrations will keep working.
