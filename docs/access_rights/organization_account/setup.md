# Setup

Once you have created your organization, you can customize it. Under the [Settings](ADD LINK) tab, you can set the organization's email address, owner and delete the account. The [Profile](ADD LINK) tab allows you to update your organization's name or set a custom profile image.

## [](#define-roles-and-permissions) Define roles and permissions

The **Roles** tab allows you to define the permissions each group of users will be granted. For example, you can have a **Read-only** role for users who will not need to update the actors, account settings or other resources.

> You'll need to define roles and their permissions before adding members to your organization.

You can see a full list of permissions that can be granted to Apify resources [here]({{@link access_rights/list_of_permissions.md}}).

## [](#invite-users-to-organization) Invite users to your organization

You can add members to your organization in the **Members** tab.

Here, you can see the status of your invitation, every user's **Role** and the option to remove users from the team.

> Users are not automatically added to your organizationsâ€“they need to accept your invitation first. This protects everyone from being added to organizations without their approval.
