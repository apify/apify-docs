# [](./scheduler)Scheduler

[Schedules](https://my.apify.com/schedules) are used to automatically start your actors at certain times. Each schedule can be associated with a number of actors and actor tasks and it is also possible to override the settings of each actor (task) in a similar fashion as when invoking the actor (task) using the API.

The schedules use [cron expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression) to specify the times of the run. The expression has the following structure:

|Position|Field|Values|Wildcards|Optional|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|1|second|0 - 59|, - * /|yes|
|2|minute|0 - 59|, - * /|no|
|3|hour|0 - 23|, - * /|no|
|4|day of month|1 - 31|, - * /|no|
|5|month|1 - 12|, - * /|no|
|6|day of week|0 - 7 (0 or 7 is Sunday)|, - * /|no|

Note that all dates and times in the cron expression are always assumed to be in the UTC time zone. The minimum interval between runs is 10 seconds; if your next run is scheduled sooner than 10 seconds after the previous run, the next run will be skipped.

Examples:  
`0 8 * * *` every day at 8am  
`0 0 * * 0` every 7 days (at 00:00 on Sunday)  
`*/3 * * * *` every 3rd minute  
`0 0 1 */2 *` every other month (at 00:00 on the first day of month, every 2nd month)

Additionally, you can use the following shortcut expressions:  
`@yearly` (`0 0 1 1 *`)  
`@monthly` (`0 0 1 * *`)  
`@weekly` (`0 0 * * 0`)  
`@daily` (`0 0 * * *`)  
`@hourly` (`0 * * * *`)

You can find more information and examples of cron expressions on [crontab.guru](http://crontab.guru/).
