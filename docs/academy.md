# [](#introduction) Introduction

Welcome to the Web Scraping Academy. A comprehensive and practical web scraping course that will take you from an absolute beginner to an expert web scraper developer. This course is sponsored by Apify, the web scraping and automation platform, but we will use only open-source technologies throughout. This means that the skills you learn will be applicable to any scraping project and you'll be able to run it on any computer. No Apify account needed.

If you would like to learn about the Apify platform and how it can help you build, run and scale your web scraping and automation projects, visit the Apify Academy, where we'll teach you all about our actors, proxies, API, scheduling, webhooks and much more.

## [](#why-learn) Why learn scraper development

With so many point and click tools and no-code software that can help you extract data from websites, what is the point of learning scraper development? Contrary to what their marketing departments say, a point and click or no-code tool will never be as flexible, as powerful or as optimized as a custom built scraper.

Any software can do only what it was programmed to do. If you build your own scraper, it can do anything you want. And you can always quickly change it to do more, or less, or the same, but faster, or cheaper. The possibilities are endless once you know how scraping really works.

Scraper development is also a fun and challenging way to learn web development, web technologies and understand the internet. You will reverse engineer websites and learn how they work internally, what technologies they use and how they communicate with their servers. When you truly understand web scraping, learning other tech like React or Next.js will be a piece of cake.

## [](#summary) Summary of the course

When we set to create the Web Scraping Academy, we wanted to build a complete guide to modern web scraping. A tutorial that a beginner could use to create their first scraper, as well as a resource that professionals will come back to learn about advanced and niche web scraping techniques. All chapters include code examples and code along exercises that you can use to immediately put your scraping skills to action.

This is what you'll learn in the Web Scraping Academy:

* [Web scraping for beginners]({{@link web_scraping_for_beginners.md}})
  * [Fundamentals of data collection]({{@link data_collection_fundamentals.md}})
  * Fundamentals of crawling
* Advanced web scraping
  * Advanced data collection techniques
    * API scraping

> We release the course content as soon as we write it, instead of launching it all at the same time much later. If you want to get notified about new chapters, you can [sign up for a free Apify account](https://apify.com/sign-up) to get our newsletters.

## [](#requirements) Requirements

You don't need to be a developer or a software engineer to complete this course, but basic programming knowledge is recommended. Don't be afraid though. We explain everything in great detail in the Web Scraping for Beginners section and provide external references that can help you level up your web scraping and development skills. If you're new to programming, pay very close attention to the instructions and examples. A seemingly insignificant thing like using `[]` instead of `()` can make a lot of difference.

As you progress to the Advanced and Pro sections, the coding will get more challenging, but still manageable to a person with an intermediate level of programming skills.

## [](#next) Next up

The course begins with short theory and continues with practical examples of collecting the most popular websites on the internet using your browser console. So let's get to it!

> If you already have experience with HTML, CSS and browser DevTools, feel free to skip to the Fundamentals of crawling chapter, or even the Advanced Web Scraping section of the course.
