## [](#cheerio-scraper)Cheerio Scraper

Cheerio Scraper is a ready-made solution for crawling the web using plain HTTP requests to retrieve HTML pages and then parsing and inspecting the HTML using the Cheerio library. It's blazing fast.

Cheerio is a server-side version of the popular jQuery library that does not run in the browser, but instead constructs a DOM out of a HTML string and then provides the user with API to work with that DOM.

Cheerio Scraper is ideal for scraping websites that do not rely on client-side JavaScript to serve their content. It can be as much as 20 times faster than using a full browser solution such as Puppeteer.
