# [](#getting-started-with-apify-scrapers)Getting started with Apify scrapers

Welcome to the getting started tutorial to walk you through creating your first scraping task step by step. You will learn how to set up all the different configuration options, code a `pageFunction` and finally download the scraped data as an Excel sheet, or in another format, such as JSON or CSV. But first, let's give you a brief introduction to Apify.

## [](#what-is-an-apify-scraper)What is an Apify scraper

It doesn't matter whether you arrived here from `apify/web-scraper`, `apify/puppeteer-scraper` or `apify/cheerio-scraper`. All of them are **actors** and for now, let's just think of **actor** as an application that you can use with your own configuration. `apify/web-scraper` is therefore an application called `web-scraper`, built by `apify`, that you can configure to scrape any webpage. We call these configurations **tasks**.

> If you need help choosing the right scraper, see this [great knowledge base article](https://kb.apify.com/tutorials-getting-started/choosing-the-right-scraper). And if you just want to learn more about actors in general, you can read our [actors page](https://apify.com/actors) or [browse the documentation]({{@link actor.md}}).

You can create 10 different **tasks** for 10 different websites, with very different options, but there will always be just one **actor**, the `apify/*-scraper` you chose. This is the essence of tasks. They are nothing but **saved configurations** of the actor that you can run easily and repeatedly.

## [](#trying-it-out)Trying it out

Depending on how you arrived at this tutorial, you may already have your first task created for the scraper of your choice. If not, the easiest way is to go to [Apify tasks](https://my.apify.com/tasks) and click the **Create a new task** button. This will present you with a list of actors to choose from. Once you select one of the actors, it will take you to its task configuration page.

> This tutorial covers the use of **Web**, **Cheerio** and **Puppeteer** scrapers, but a lot of the information here can be used with all actors.

![actor-selection]({{@asset scraping/images/actor-selection.jpg}} "Selecting the best actor")

### [](#running-a-task)Running a task

You are now in the INPUT tab of the task configuration. Before we delve into the details, let's just see how the example works. There are already some values pre-configured in the INPUT. It says that the task should visit `https://apify.com` and all its subpages, such as `https://apify.com/contact` and scrape some data using the provided `pageFunction`, specifically the `<title>` of the page and its URL.

Scroll down a bit and set the `Max pages per run` option to `10`. This tells your task to finish after 10 pages have been visited. We don't need to crawl the whole domain just to see that it works.

> It also helps with keeping your compute unit (CU) consumption low. Just to get an idea, the free plan includes 10 CUs and this run will consume about 0.04 CU, so you can run it 250 times a month for free. If you accidentally go over the limit, no worries, we won't charge you for it. You just won't be able to run more tasks that month.

Now click **Save & Run**! _(either at the very bottom or in the top-right corner of your screen)_

### [](#the-run-detail)The run detail

After clicking **Save & Run**, the window will change to the run detail. Here, you will see the Log of the run. If it seems that nothing is happening, don't worry, it takes a few seconds for the run to fully boot up. In under a minute, you should have the 10 pages scraped. You will know that the run successfully completed when the `RUNNING` card in top-left corner changes to `SUCCEEDED`.

> Feel free to browse through the various new tabs: LOG, INFO, INPUT and other, but for the sake of brevity, we will not explain all their features in this tutorial.

Now that the run has `SUCCEEDED`, click on the rightmost card labeled **Clean items** to see the results of the scrape. This takes you to the DATASET tab, where you can display or download the results in various formats. For now, just click the blue **Preview data** button. Voila, the scraped data.

![run detail]({{@asset scraping/images/the-run-detail.jpg}} "Viewing results in the run detail.")

Good job! We've run our first task and got some results. Let's learn how to change the default configuration to scrape something more interesting than just the page's `<title>`.

## [](#creating-your-own-task)Creating your own task

Before we jump into the scraping itself, let's just have a quick look at the user interface that's available to us.

### [](#input)INPUT

The INPUT tab is where we started and it's the place where you create your scraping configuration. The creator of the actor prepares the INPUT form so that you can easily tell the actor what to do. Feel free to check the tooltips of the various options to get a better idea of what they do. To display the tooltip, just click the name of any of the input fields.

> We will not go through all the available INPUT options in this tutorial. See the actor's README under the ACTOR INFO tab for detailed information.

### [](#settings)SETTINGS

In the settings tab, you can set various options that are common to all tasks and not directly related to the scraping itself. Unless you've already changed the task's name, it's `my-task`, so why not try changing it to `my-first-scraper` and clicking save. Below are the Build, Timeout and Memory options. Let's keep them at default settings for now. Just remember that if you see a big red `TIMED-OUT` after running your task, you might want to come back here and increase the timeout.

> Timeouts are there to prevent tasks from running forever. Always set a reasonable timeout to prevent a rogue task from eating up all your compute units.

### [](#actor-info)ACTOR INFO

Since tasks are just configurations for actors, this tab shows you all the information about the underlying actor, the Apify scraper of your choice. You can see the available versions and their READMEs and it's always a good idea to read an actor's README first before creating a task for it.

### [](#webhooks)WEBHOOKS

Webhooks are a feature that help keep you aware of what's happening with your tasks. You can set them up to inform you when a task starts, finishes, fails and so on, or you can even use them to run more tasks, depending on the outcome of the original one. You can find the [documentation on webhooks here]({{@link webhooks.md}}).

### [](#runs)RUNS

You can find all the task runs and their detail pages here. Every time you start a task, it will appear here in the list. All runs of your task including their results will be stored here for the data retention period, [which you can find under your plan](https://apify.com/pricing).

### [](#api)API

The API tab gives you a quick overview of all the available API calls, if you would like to use your task programmatically. It also includes links to detailed API documentation. You can even try it out immediately using the **TEST** button.

## [](#scraping-theory)Scraping theory

Since this is a tutorial, we'll be scraping our own website. A great candidate for some scraping practice is the [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store). It's a page that uses modern web technologies and displays a lot of different items in various categories, just like an online store, a typical scraping target, would.

### [](#the-goal)The goal

We want to create a scraper that scrapes all the actors (i.e. not crawlers, our legacy product) in the store and collects the following attributes for each actor:

1.  **URL** - The URL that goes directly to the actor's detail page.
2.  **Unique identifier** - Such as `apify/web-scraper`.
3.  **Title** - The title visible in the actor's detail page.
4.  **Description** - The actor's description.
5.  **Last run date**- When the actor was last run.
6.  **Number of runs** - How many times the actor was run.

Some of this information may be scraped directly from the listing pages, but for the rest, we will need to visit all detail pages of all the actors.

### [](#the-start-url)The Start URL

Let's start with something simple. In the INPUT tab of the task we have, we'll change the Start URL from `https://apify.com`. This will tell the scraper to start by opening a different URL. You can add more Start URLs or even use a file with a list of thousands of them, but in this case, we'll be good with just one.

How do we choose the new Start URL? The goal is to scrape all actors in the store and the store is available at [https://apify.com/store](https://apify.com/store) so we choose this URL as our Start URL.

    https://apify.com/store

We also need to somehow distinguish the Start URL from all the other URLs that the scraper will add later. To do this, click the green **Details** icon in the Start URL form and see the **User data** input. Here you can add any information you'll need during the scrape in a JSON format. For now, just add a label to the Start URL.

    {
      "label": "START"
    }

![start url input]({{@asset scraping/images/the-start-url.jpg}} "Adding new Start URL.")

### [](#crawling-the-website-with-pseudo-urls)Crawling the website with Pseudo URLs

What is a Pseudo URL? Let me explain. Before we can start scraping the actor details, we need to find all the links to the details. If the links follow a set structure, we can use a certain pattern to describe this structure. And that's what a Pseudo URL is. A pattern that describes a URL structure. By setting a Pseudo URL, all links that follow the given structure will automatically be added to the crawling queue.

Let's see an example. To find the pattern, open some of the actor details in the store. You'll find that the URLs are always structured the same:

    https://apify.com/{OWNER}/{NAME}

Where only the `OWNER` and `NAME` changes. We can leverage this in a Pseudo URL.

#### [](#making-a-pseudo-url)Making a Pseudo URL

If you'd like to learn more about Pseudo URLs, [visit a quick tutorial in our docs](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/guides/gettingstarted#introduction-to-pseudo-urls), but for now, let's keep it simple. Pseudo URLs are really just URLs with some variable parts in them. Those variable parts are represented by [regular expressions](https://regexone.com/) enclosed in brackets `[]`.

So, working with our actor details example, we could produce a Pseudo URL like this:

    https://apify.com/[.+]/[.+]

This Pseudo URL will match all actor detail pages, such as:

    https://apify.com/apify/web-scraper

But it will not match pages we're not interested in, such as:

    https://apify.com/contact

Let's use the above Pseudo URL in our task. We should also add a label as we did with our Start URL. This label will be added to all pages that were enqueued into the request queue using the given Pseudo URL.

    {
      "label": "DETAIL"
    }

![pseudo url input]({{@asset scraping/images/making-a-pseudo-url.jpg}} "Adding new Pseudo URL.")

### [](#filtering-with-a-link-selector)Filtering with a link selector

Pseudo URLs are just one part of your URL matching arsenal. The other one is the **Link selector** which you can find right under the Pseudo URLs input field. It's a CSS selector and its purpose is to select the HTML elements where the scraper should look for URLs. And by looking for URLs we mean finding the elements' 'href' attributes. For example, to enqueue URLs from `<div class="my-class" href=...>` tags, you would enter `'div.my-class'`.

What's the connection to Pseudo URLs? Well, first, all the URLs found in the elements that match the link selector are collected. Then, Pseudo URLs are used to filter those URLs an enqueue only the ones that match the Pseudo URL structure. Simple.

To scrape all the actors in store, we should use the Link selector to further filter the links that our Pseudo URL matches. For example, we're not interested in the following URL:

    https://apify.com/docs/actor

Even though it matches our Pseudo URL, it's not a link to an actor, but a link to documenation. To prevent links like those from being visited, we should specify a Link selector that filters them out. For now, let us just tell you that the Link selector you're looking for is:

    div.item > a

Save it as your Link selector. If you're wondering how we figured this out, just follow along with the tutorial. By the time we finish, you'll know why we used this selector too.

### [](#test-run)Test run

We've added some configuration, so it's time to test it. Just run the task, keeping the **Max pages per run** set to `10` and **Page function** the same. You should see in the log that the scraper first visits the Start URL and then several of the actor details, matching the Pseudo URL.

### [](#the--code-pagefunction--code-)The `pageFunction`

The Page function is a JavaScript function that gets executed for each page the scraper visits. To figure out how to create the `pageFunction`, you must first inspect the page's structure to get an idea of its inner workings. The best tools for that are Developer Tools in browsers, DevTools.

#### [](#using-devtools)Using DevTools

Open the [store page](https://apify.com/store) in the Chrome browser (or use any other browser, just note that the DevTools may differ slightly) and open the DevTools, either by right-clicking on the page and selecting `Inspect` or by pressing `F12`.

The DevTools window will pop up, and display a lot of, perhaps unfamiliar, information. Don't worry about that too much and just open the Elements tab (the one with the page's HTML). The Elements tab allows you to browse the structure of the page and search within it using the search tool. You can open the search tool by pressing `CTRL+F` or `CMD+F`. Try typing `<title>` into the search bar.

You'll see that the Element tab jumps to the first `<title>` element of the current page and that the title is `Store`. It's always good practice to do your research using the DevTools before writing the `pageFunction` and running your task.

![devtools]({{@asset scraping/images/using-devtools.jpg}} "Finding title element in DevTools.")

> For the sake of brevity, we won't go into the details of using the DevTools in this tutorial. If you're just starting out with DevTools, this [Google tutorial](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) is a good place to begin.

#### [](#understanding--code-context--code-)Understanding `context`

The `pageFunction` has access to global variables, such as `window` or `document`, which are provided by the browser, but also to `context`, which is the single argument of the `pageFunction`. `context` carries a lot of useful information and helpful functions. A full reference can be found in the actor's README in the ACTOR INFO tab.

#### [](#new--code-pagefunction--code--boilerplate)New `pageFunction` boilerplate

We know that we'll visit two kinds of pages, the list page (Start URL) and the detail pages (enqueued using the Pseudo URL). We want to enqueue links on the list page and scrape data on the detail page.

    async function pageFunction(context) {
        const { request, log, skipLinks } = context;
        if (request.userData.label === 'START') {
            log.info('Store opened!');
            // Do some stuff later.
        }
        if (request.userData.label === 'DETAIL') {
            log.info(`Scraping ${request.url}`);
            await skipLinks();
            // Do some scraping.
            return {
                // Scraped data.
            }
        }
    }

This may seem like a lot of new things, but it's all connected to our earlier configuration.

#### [](#-code-context-request--code-)`context.request`

The `request` is an instance of the [`Request`](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/api/request) class and holds information about the currently processed page, such as its `url`. Each `request` also has the `request.userData` property of type `Object`. While configuring the Start URL and the Pseudo URL, we set a `label` to it. We're now using it in the `pageFunction` to distinguish between the store page and the detail pages.

#### [](#-code-context-skiplinks----code-)`context.skipLinks()`

When a Pseudo URL is set, the scraper attempts to enqueue matching links on all pages it visits. `skipLinks()` is used to tell the scraper that we don't want this to happen on the current page.

#### [](#-code-context-log--code-)`context.log`

`log` is used for printing messages to the console. You may be tempted to use `console.log()`, but this will not work, unless you turn on the **Browser log** option. `log.info()` should be used for general messages, but you can also use `log.debug()` for messages that will only be shown when you turn on the **Debug log** option. [See the docs for more info](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/api/log).

#### [](#return-value-of-the--code-pagefunction--code-)Return value of the `pageFunction`

The `pageFunction` may only return nothing, `null`, `Object` or `Object[]`. If an `Object` is returned, it will be saved as a single result. Returning an `Array` of `Objects` will save each item in the array as a result.

The scraping results are saved in Dataset (one of the tabs in the run console, as you may remember). It behaves like a table. Each item is a row in the table and its properties are its columns. Returning the following `Object`:

    {
        url: 'https://apify.com',
        title: 'Web Scraping, Data Extraction and Automation - Apify'
    }

Will produce the following table:

|title|url|
|--- |--- |
|Web Scraping, Data Extraction and Automation - Apify|[https://apify.com](https://apify.com)|

### [](#scraper-lifecycle)Scraper Lifecycle

Now that we're familiar with all the pieces in the puzzle, we'll quickly take a look at the scraper lifecycle, or in other words, what does the scraper actually do when it scrapes. It's quite straightforward.

The scraper

1.  visits the first **Start URL** and waits for the page to load.
2.  executes the `pageFunction`.
3.  finds all the elements matching the **Link selector** and extracts their `href` attributes (URLs).
4.  uses the **Pseudo URLs** to filter the extracted URLs and throws away those that don't match.
5.  enqueues the matching URLs to the end of the crawling queue.
6.  closes the page and selects a new URL to visit, either from the Start URLs if there are any left, or from the beginning of the crawling queue.

> When you're not using the request queue, the scraper just repeats the steps 1 and 2\. You would not use the request queue when you already know all the URLs you want to visit. For example, when you have a pre-existing list of a thousand URLs that you uploaded as a text file. Or when scraping just a single URL.

## [](#scraping-basics)Scraping basics

We've covered all the concepts that we need to understand to successfully scrape the data in our goal, so let's get to it and start with something really simple. We will only output data that are already available to us in the page's URL. Remember from [our goal](#the-goal) that we also want to include the **URL** and a **Unique identifier** in our results. To get those, we just need the `request.url` because it is the URL and includes the Unique identifier.

    const { url } = request; 
    const uniqueIdentifier = url.split('/').slice(-2).join('/');

### [](#test-run-2)Test run 2

We'll add our first data to the `pageFunction` and carry out a test run to see that everything works as expected.

    async function pageFunction(context) {
        const { request, log, skipLinks } = context;
        if (request.userData.label === 'START') {
            log.info('Store opened!');
            // Do some stuff later.
        }
        if (request.userData.label === 'DETAIL') {
            const { url } = request;
            log.info(`Scraping ${url}`);
            await skipLinks();

            // Do some scraping.
            const uniqueIdentifier = url.split('/').slice(-2).join('/');

            return {
                url,
                uniqueIdentifier,
            }
        }
    }

Now **Save & Run** the task and once it finishes, check the results by going to the Dataset, either by clicking the **Clean items** card, or by going to the **DATASET** tab. Click **Preview data** again (and check Clean data, if unchecked). You should see the URLs and Unique identifiers scraped. Great job!

## [](#choosing-sides)Choosing sides

Up until now, everything has been the same for all the Apify scrapers. Whether you're using `apify/web-scraper`, `apify/puppeteer-scraper` or `apify/cheerio-scraper`, what you've learned now will always be the same. This is great if you ever need to switch scrapers, because there's no need to learn everything from scratch.

There are differences in the code we use in the `pageFunction` though. Often subtle, sometimes large. In the next part of the tutorial, we'll focus on specific implementation details of the individual scrapers. So it's time to choose sides. But don't worry, at Apify, no side is the dark side.
