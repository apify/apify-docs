## [](#puppeteer-scraper)Puppeteer Scraper

Puppeteer Scraper is the most powerful scraper tool in our arsenal (aside from developing your own actors). It uses the Puppeteer library to programmatically control a headless Chrome browser and it can make it do almost anything. If using the Web Scraper does not cut it, Puppeteer Scraper is what you need.

Puppeteer is a Node.js library, so knowledge of Node.js and its paradigms is expected when working with the Puppeteer Scraper.
