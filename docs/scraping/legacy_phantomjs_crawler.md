## [](#phantomjs-crawler)Legacy PhantomJS Crawler

Legacy PhantomJS Crawler is the actor compatible with an original Apify Crawler that you may have known. It supports the same input and produces the same output. But it uses legacy technology and if you're starting a new project, we recommend using our other solutions that run on the Apify Actor platform and use Chrome as the browser instead, such as [Web Scraper](#web-scraper) above.
