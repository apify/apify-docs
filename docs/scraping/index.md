# [](./scraping)Scraping with Apify

Scraping and crawling the web can be difficult and time consuming without the right tools. That's why Apify provides ready-made solutions to crawl and scrape any website. They are based on our [Actor](/actors) product and the [Apify SDK](https://sdk.apify.com).

Don't let the number of options confuse you. Unless you're really sure that you need to use a specific tool, just go ahead and use the [Web Scraper](#web-scraper). It is the easiest to pick up and can handle almost anything. Look at [Puppeteer Scraper](#puppeteer-scraper) or [Cheerio Scraper](#cheerio-scraper) only after you know your target websites well and need to optimize your scraper.
