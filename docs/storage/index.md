# [](./storage)Storage

The Apify platform contains three storage types that you can use in your [actors]({{@link actor/index.md}}) and also outside the Apify platform using [HTTP API](https://apify.com/docs/api/v2) and [JavaScript client](https://apify.com/docs/api/apify-client-js/latest).

*   [Key-value store]({{@link storage/key_value_store.md}}) - simple storage for strings and files
*   [Dataset]({{@link storage/dataset.md}}) - storage for sequential data objects (results)
*   [Request queue]({{@link storage/request_queue.md}}) - dynamic queue of URLs to be processed
