# [](./storage)Storage

The Apify platform contains three storage types that you can use in your [actors](/docs/actor) and also outside the Apify platform using [HTTP API](/docs/api/v2) and [JavaScript client](/docs/api/apify-client-js/latest).

*   [Key-value store](#key-value-store) - simple storage for strings and files
*   [Dataset](#dataset) - storage for sequential data objects (results)
*   [Request queue](#queue) - dynamic queue of URLs to be processed
