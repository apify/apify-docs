# [](#dataset) Dataset

Dataset storage enables you to sequentially save and retrieve data. Each actor run is assigned its own dataset, which is created when the first item is stored to it.

Datasets usually contain results from web scraping, crawling or data processing jobs. The data can be visualized as a table where each object is a row and its attributes are the columns. The data can be exported in JSON, CSV, XML, RSS, Excel or HTML formats.

> Named datasets are retained indefinitely. <br/>
> Unnamed datasets expire after 7 days unless otherwise specified. <br/>
> [Learn about named and unnamed datasets.]({{@link storage.md#named-and-unnamed-storages}})

Dataset storage is *append-only* - data can only be added and cannot be changed or deleted.

## [](#basic-usage) Basic usage

There are four ways to access your datasets:

* [Apify app](https://my.apify.com/storage#/datasets) - provides an easy-to-understand interface [[details](#apify-app)]
* [Apify software development kit (SDK)](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/guides/data-storage#dataset) - when building your own Apify actor [[details](#apify-sdk)]
* [JavaScript API client](https://docs.apify.com/api/apify-client-js/latest#ApifyClient-datasets) - to access your datasets from any Node.js application [[details](#javascript-api-client)]
* [Apify API](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2#/reference/datasets) - for accessing your datasets programmatically [[details](#apify-api)]

### [](#apify-app) Apify app

In the [Apify app](https://my.apify.com), you can view your datasets in the [Storage](https://my.apify.com/storage) section under the [Datasets](https://my.apify.com/storage#/datasets) tab.

Only named datasets are displayed by default. Select the *Include unnamed datasets* checkbox to display all of your datasets.

![Datasets in app]({{@asset storage/images/datasets-app.png}})

To view or download a dataset in the above mentioned formats, click on its *Dataset ID*. In the detail page, you can update the dataset's name (and, in turn, its [retention period]({{@link storage.md#data-retention}})) and
[access rights]({{@link access_rights.md}}) under the *Settings* tab. The API tab allows you to view and test the dataset's [API endpoints](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2#/reference/datasets).

### [](#apify-sdk) Apify SDK

If you are building an [Apify actor]({{@link actors.md}}), you will be using the [Apify software development kit (SDK)](https://sdk.apify.com).
In the [Apify SDK](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/guides/data-storage#dataset), the dataset is represented by the
[`Dataset`](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/api/dataset) class.

You can use the `Dataset` class to specify whether your data is stored locally or on in the Apify cloud, push data to datasets of your choice using the `pushData()` [method](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/examples/add-data-to-dataset), and perform functions such as `getData()`, `map()` and `reduce()`([see example](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/examples/map-and-reduce)).

If you have chosen to store your dataset locally, you can find it in the location below.

    {APIFY_LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR}/datasets/{DATASET_ID}/{INDEX}.json

*DATASET_ID* refers to the dataset's *name* or *ID*. The default dataset will be stored in the *default* directory.

To add data to the default dataset, you can use the example below, however using the `Apify.main()` function is optionalâ€“it is only provided for your convenience.

```js
// Import the Apify SDK into your project
const Apify = require("apify");

// The optional Apify.main() function performs the
// actor's job and terminates the process when it is finished
Apify.main(async () => {

    // Add one item to the default dataset
    await Apify.pushData({ foo: "bar" });

    // Add multiple items to the default dataset
    await Apify.pushData([{ foo: "hotel" }, { foo: "cafe" }]);
});
```

> Make sure to use the `await` keyword when calling `pushData()`, otherwise the actor process might finish before the data are stored.

If you want to use something other than the default dataset, e.g. a dataset that you share between actors or between actor runs, you can use the [Apify.openDataset()](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/api/apify#apifyopendatasetdatasetidorname-options) method.

```js
// Save a named dataset to a variable
const dataset = await Apify.openDataset("some-name");

// Add data to the named dataset
await dataset.pushData({ foo: "bar" });
```

When using the `getData()` method, you can specify the data you retrieve using the `[fields]` parameter. It should be an array of field names (strings) that will be included in the results. To include all the results, simply omit the `[fields]` parameter.

```js
// Only get the "hotel" and "cafe" fields
const hotelAndCafeData = await dataset.getData({
    fields: ["hotel", "cafe"]
});
```

For more information on managing datasets using the Apify SDK, see the [SDK documentation](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/guides/data-storage#dataset) and the `Dataset` class's [API reference](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/api/dataset#datasetpushdatadata).

### [](#javascript-api-client) JavaScript API client

Apify's [JavaScript API client](https://docs.apify.com/apify-client-js#ApifyClient-datasets) (`apify-client`) allows you to access your datasets from any Node.js application, whether it is running on the Apify platform or elsewhere.

For help with setting up the client, see the JavaScript API client section on the [overview page](https://docs.apify.com/storage/#javascript-api-client).

After [importing](https://docs.apify.com/storage/#javascript-api-client) the `apify-client` package into your application and creating an instance of it, save it to a variable for easier access.

```js
// Save your datasets to a variable for easier access
const datasets = apifyClient.datasets;
```

You can then create, update, and delete datasets using the commands below.

```js
// Get the dataset with the name "my-dataset"
// or create it if it doesn't exist
const dataset = await datasets.getOrCreateDataset({
    datasetName: "my-dataset",
});

// Set the dataset as the default to be used
// in the following commands
apifyClient.setOptions({ datasetId: dataset.id });

// Add an object and and array of objects to the dataset
await datasets.putItems({
    data: { foo: "bar" }
});
await datasets.putItems({
    data: [{ foo: "hotel" }, { foo: "cafe" }]
});

// Get items from a dataset
const paginationList = await datasets.getItems();
const items = paginationList.items;

// Delete a dataset
await datasets.deleteDataset();
```

When using the `getItems()` method, you can specify the data you retrieve using the `[fields]` parameter. It should be an array of field names (strings) that will be included in the results. To include all the results, simply omit the `[fields]` parameter.

```js
// Only get the "hotel" and "cafe" fields
const hotelAndCafeData = await datasets.getItems({
    fields: ["hotel", "cafe"]
});
```

> If you both specify and omit the same field in a request, the **omit** parameter will prevail and the field will not be returned.


For more information, see the JavaScript API client [documentation](https://docs.apify.com/apify-client-js#ApifyClient-datasets).

### [](#apify-api) Apify API

The [Apify API](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2#/reference/datasets) allows you to access your datasets programmatically using [HTTP requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) and easily share your crawling results.

If you are accessing your datasets using the *username~store-name* [store ID format]({{@link storage.md#apify-api}}), you will need to append your [secret API token](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2#/introduction/authentication) as a query parameter (see below). You can find the token (and your user ID) on the [Integrations](https://my.apify.com/account#/integrations) page of your Apify account.

To **get a list of your datasets**, send a GET request to the [Get list of datasets](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2#/reference/datasets/get-list-of-datasets) endpoint, providing your API token as a query parameter.

    https://api.apify.com/v2/datasets?token={YOUR_API_TOKEN}

To **get information about a dataset** such as its creation time and *item count*, send a GET request to the [Get dataset](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2#/reference/datasets/dataset/get-dataset) endpoint.

    https://api.apify.com/v2/datasets/{DATASET_ID}?token={YOUR_API_TOKEN}

To **view a dataset's data**, send a GET request to the
[Get dataset items](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2#/reference/datasets/item-collection/get-items) Apify API endpoint.

    https://api.apify.com/v2/datasets/{DATASET_ID}/items/?token={YOUR_API_TOKEN}

You can **specify which data are exported** by adding a comma-separated list of fields to the *fields* query parameter. Likewise, you can also omit certain fields using the *omit* parameter.

> If you both specify and omit the same field in a request, the **omit** parameter will prevail and the field will not be returned.

To retrieve the *hotel* and *cafe* fields, you would send your GET request to the URL below.

    https://api.apify.com/v2/datasets/{DATASET_ID}/items?token={YOUR_API_TOKEN}&fields=hotel%2Ccafe

> Instead of commas, you will need to use the `%2C` code, which represents `,` in URL encoding.<br/>
> Learn more about URL encoding [here](https://www.url-encode-decode.com).

To **add data to a dataset**, send a POST request, with a JSON object containing the data you want to add as the payload to the [Put items](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2#/reference/datasets/item-collection/put-items) endpoint.

    https://api.apify.com/v2/datasets/{DATASET_ID}/items/?token={YOUR_API_TOKEN}

Example payload:
```json
[
    {
        "foo": "bar"
    },
    {
        "foo": "hotel"
    },
    {
        "foo": "cafe"
    }
]
```
For a detailed breakdown of each API endpoint, see the [API documentation](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2#/reference/datasets).

## [](#hidden-fields) Hidden fields

Top-level fields starting with the `#` character are considered hidden.
These fields may be easily omitted when downloading the data from a dataset by providing the *skipHidden=1* or *clean=1* query parameters. This provides a convenient way to store debug information that should not appear in the final dataset.

Below is an example of a dataset record containing hidden fields with an HTTP response and error.

```json
{
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "title": "Example page",
    "data": {
        "foo": "bar"
    },
    "#error": null,
    "#response": {
        "statusCode": 201
    }
}
```

Data without hidden fields are called "clean" and can be downloaded from the [Apify app](https://my.apify.com/storage#/datasets) using the "Clean items" link or via API using the *clean=true* or *clean=1* [URL parameters](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2#/reference/datasets/item-collection/put-items).

## [](#xml-format-extension) XML format extension

When you export results to XML or RSS formats, object property names become XML tags, while the corresponding values become the tags' children.

For example, the JavaScript object:

```js
{
    name: "Rashida Jones",
    address: [
        {
            type: "home",
            street: "21st",
            city: "Chicago",
        },
        {
            type: "office",
            street: null,
            city: null,
        }
    ]
}
```

becomes the following XML snippet:

```xml
<name>Rashida Jones</name>
<address>
    <type>home</type>
    <street>21st</street>
    <city>Chicago</city>
</address>
<address>
    <type>office</type>
    <street/>
    <city/>
</address>
```

If the JavaScript object contains a property named `@`, its sub-properties are exported as attributes of the parent XML element. If the parent XML element does not have any child elements, its value is taken from a JavaScript object property named `#`.

For example, the following JavaScript object:

```js
{
    "address": [{
        "@": {
            "type": "home",
        },
        "street": "21st",
        "city": "Chicago",
    },
    {
        "@": {
            "type": "office",
        },
        "#": "unknown",
    }]
}
```

will be transformed to the following XML snippet:

```xml
<address type="home">
    <street>21st</street>
    <city>Chicago</city>
</address>
<address type="office">unknown</address>
```

This feature is also useful when customizing your RSS feeds generated for various websites.

By default, the whole result is wrapped in an `<items/>` emelent, while each page object is contained in an `<item/>` element. You can change this using the `xmlRoot` and `xmlRow` URL parameters when GETting your data.

## [](#sharing-datasets-between-runs) Sharing datasets between runs

You can access a dataset from any [actor]({{@link actors.md}}) or [task]({{@link actors/tasks.md}}) run as long as you know its *name* or *ID*.

To access a dataset from another run using the Apify SDK, open it using the `Apify.openDataset([datasetIdOrName])` [method](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/api/apify#apifyopendatasetdatasetidorname-options) like you would any other dataset.

```js
const otherDataset = await Apify.openDataset("old-dataset");
```

To access a dataset using the [JavaScript API client](#javascript-api-client), use the `getOrCreateDataset()` [method](https://docs.apify.com/apify-client-js#ApifyClient-datasets).

```js
const otherDataset = await datasets.getOrCreateDataset({
    datasetName: "my-dataset",
});
```

Once you've opened the dataset, read its contents and add new data like you would with a dataset from your current run.

The same applies for the [Apify API](#apify-api) - you can use [the same endpoints](#apify-api) as you would normally.

For more information on sharing storages between runs, see the Storage [overview page](https://docs.apify.com/storage/#sharing-storages-between-runs).


## [](#limits) Limits

* Tabulated data storage formats (ones that display the data in columns), such as HTML, CSV, and EXCEL, have a maximum limit of **3000** columns. All data that do not fit into this limit will not be retrieved.

* When using the `pushData()` method, the size of the data is limited by the receiving API. Therefore, `pushData()` will only allow objects whose JSON representation is smaller than **9MB**. When an array is passed, none of the included objects may be larger than 9MB, however the array itself may be of any size.
