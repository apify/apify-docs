# [](#dataset)Dataset

Dataset storage enables you to save and retrieve sequential data objects which share the same attribute. Each actor run is assigned its own datasetâ€“it is created when the first item is stored to it.

Datasets usually contain results from web scraping, crawling or data processing jobs. The data can be visualized as a table where each object is a row and its attributes are the columns. Data from the dataset can be exported in JSON, CSV, XML, RSS, Excel or HTML formats.

> Named datasets are retained indefinitely <br/>
> Unnamed datasets expire after 7 days unless otherwise specified

Dataset storage is immutable - data can only be added and cannot be changed. You [add data to a dataset](#api) using the `Put items` endpoint in the [Apify API](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2#/reference/datasets/item-collection/put-items?console=1).

There are four ways to access your datasets:

* [Apify app](https://my.apify.com) - provides an easy-to-understand interface ([more details](#app))
* [Apify software development kit (SDK)](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/guides/data-storage#dataset) - when building your own Apify actor ([more details](#sdk))
* [Apify JavaScript client](https://docs.apify.com/api/apify-client-js/latest#ApifyClient-datasets) - to access your datasets from outside the Apify platform (e.g. when building a Node.js application) ([more details](#js-client))
* [Apify API](#https://docs.apify.com/api/v2#/reference/datasets) - for accessing your datasets programmatically ([more details](#api))

## [](#basic-usage) Basic usage

### [](#app) Apify app

In the [Apify app](https://my.apify.com), you can view your datasets under the [Datasets](https://my.apify.com/storage#/datasets) tab in the [Storage](https://my.apify.com/storage) section.

Only named datasets are displayed by default. Select the `Include unnamed datasets` checkbox to display all of your datasets.

![Datasets in app]({{@asset storage/images/datasets-app.png}})

To view or download a dataset in various formats, click on its `Dataset ID`. In the detail page, you can update the dataset's name (and, in turn, its retention period) and
[access rights]({{@link access_rights.md}}) under the `Settings` tab. The API tab allows you to view and test the dataset's [API endpoints](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2#/reference/datasets).

### [](#sdk) Apify SDK

If you are building an [Apify actor]({{@link actors.md}}), you will be using the [Apify SDK](https://sdk.apify.com).
In the [Apify SDK](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/guides/data-storage#dataset), the dataset is represented by the [`Dataset`](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/guides/data-storage#dataset) class.

You can use the `Dataset` class to specify whether your data is stored locally on in the Apify cloud, push data to datasets of your choice using the `pushData()` method, and perform functions such as `getData()` and `reduce()`. For more information on this, see the [Apify SDK documentation](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/guides/data-storage#dataset).

If you have chosen to store your dataset locally, you can find it in the following files:

    {APIFY_LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR}/datasets/{DATASET_ID}/{INDEX}.json

> `DATASET_ID` refers to the dataset's `name` or `ID`. The default dataset will be stored in the `default` directory.

To add data to the default dataset, you can use the below example.

    const Apify = require('apify');

    Apify.main(async () => {
        
        // Add one item to the default dataset:
        await Apify.pushData({ foo: 'bar' });

        // Add multiple items to the default dataset:
        await Apify.pushData([
            { foo: 'hotel' },
            { foo: 'restaurant' },
        ]);
    });

> Make sure to use the `await` keyword when calling `pushData()`, otherwise the actor process might finish before the data is stored!

If you want to use something other than the default dataset, e.g. a dataset that you share between actors or between actor runs, you can use the [`Apify.openDataset()` method](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/api/apify#apifyopendatasetdatasetidorname-options)].

    const dataset = await Apify.openDataset('some-name');

    // Add data to the named dataset
    await dataset.pushData({ foo: 'bar' });

For more information on managing datasets using the Apify SDK, see the [SDK documentation](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/api/dataset).

### [](#js-client) Apify JavaScript client

Use if you're accessing your dataset from a Node.js application outside the Apify platform.





### [](#api) Apify API
[Apify API](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2#/reference/datasets)

Talk about the API and provide links to several endpoints, such as update, create, get list of datasets.

ADD HOW TO ADD DATA USING THE PUT DATA ENDPOINT

## [](#hidden-fields) Hidden fields

Hidden fields are fields starting with the `#` character. These fields might be easily omitted when downloading the data from a dataset and therefore provides a convenient way to store debug information that should not appear in the final dataset. Here is an example of a dataset record containing hidden fields with an HTTP response and error:

    {
        "url": "https://example.com",
        "title": "Example page",
        "data": {
            "foo": "bar"
        },
        "#error": null,
        "#response": {
            "statusCode": 201
        }
    }

Data without hidden fields are called "clean" and can be downloaded at Apify app using the "clean items" link or via API using a URL parameter `clean=true`.






# ------- OLD STUFF ---------
Each actor run is assigned its own dataset, created when the first item is stored to it. 

<!-- Where? How can I access it? Talk about the ID -->
The ID of this dataset is available under `run.defaultDatasetId`.

<!-- elaborate. provide info for SDK and app users -->
In your actor you can use shorthand methods to save items into the default dataset - `Apify.pushData()` [[see docs](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/api/apify#apifypushdataitem)].

    const Apify = require('apify');

    Apify.main(async () => {
        // Put one item into the dataset:
        await Apify.pushData({ foo: 'bar' });

        // Put multiple items into the dataset:
        await Apify.pushData([
            { foo: 'hotel' },
            { foo: 'restaurant' },
        ]);
    });

<!--  How can we do this in-app? -->
If you want to use something other than the default dataset, e.g. some dataset that you share between actors or between actor runs, then you can use `Apify.openDataset()` [[see docs](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/api/apify#apifyopendatasetdatasetidorname-options)]:

    const dataset = await Apify.openDataset('some-name');

    await dataset.pushData({ foo: 'bar' });

## [](#api-and-javascript-client)API and JavaScript client

The dataset provides a [HTTP API](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2#/reference/datasets) to manage datasets and to add/retrieve their data. If you are developing a Node.js application, then you can also use the [Apify JavaScript client](https://docs.apify.com/api/apify-client-js/latest#ApifyClient-datasets).
