# [](./proxy)Proxy

Apify Proxy provides access to Apify's proxy services that can be used in [actors]({{@link actor.md}}) or any other application that support HTTP proxies. Currently, Apify Proxy provides access to [datacenter proxy servers]({{@link proxy/datacenter_proxy.md}}), [residential proxy]({{@link proxy/residential_proxy.md}}), and [Google SERP proxy]({{@link proxy/google_serp_proxy.md}}). It supports HTTP as well as other protocols like HTTPS and FTP.

You can view your Apify Proxy settings on the [Proxy page](https://my.apify.com/proxy) in the app.
