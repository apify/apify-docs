# Introduction

Welcome to the Apify documentation.

If you're new to Apify, it's great to meet you! Let's get you up to speed with what we do.

Apify is an online cloud platform specializing in web scraping, data extraction and robotic process automation. With Apify, you can easily compare prices of services or generate new leads for your business by extracting structured data from websites. In addition, you can use our tools to automate manual workflows such as filling in forms or uploading files.

This site contains everything you need to know about using Apify, from beginner-friendly [tutorials]({{@link tutorials.md}}) for using our ready-made scrapers to information about how to [develop]({{@link actors/development.md}}) your own actors, manage your [stored data]({{@link storage.md}}) or reduce blocking using [proxies]({{@link proxy.md}}).

We are always trying to improve our documentation, so if you have any feedback, please let us know using the **Feedback** button on the right.

## [](#get-started) Get started

Almost everything we do is centered around [actors]({{@link actors.md}}). Actors are cloud programs running on the Apify platform that can scrape web pages, process data or automate workflows. You can learn more about actors by checking out their [documentation]({{@link actors.md}}).

Once you're familiar with the basics, you can visit [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store) and try some of our ready-made tools such as the **Booking Scraper** ([dtrungtin/booking-scraper](https://apify.com/dtrungtin/booking-scraper)), **SEO Audit Tool** ([drobnikj/seo-audit-tool](https://apify.com/drobnikj/seo-audit-tool)), or the **Google Sheets Import & Export** ([lukaskrivka/google-sheets](https://apify.com/lukaskrivka/google-sheets)) tool.

### [](#tutorials) Tutorials

If you're interested in learning how to scrape websites or automate processes using Apify, visit our [tutorials]({{@link tutorials.md}}). They will walk you through the principles of our scraping tools and prepare you for more advanced projects.

To learn how to build your own actor from scratch, you can use the [Apify SDK](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/guides/getting-started). It is a scalable JavaScript/Node.js library tailor-made for data extraction and web automation jobs (not only) with [headless Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome) and [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/).

## [](#experienced-users) Experienced users

For everything you need to know about Apify actors such as [development]({{@link actors/development.md}}), [running]({{@link actors/running.md}}), [publishing]({{@link actors/publishing.md}}) or [platform limits]({{@link actors/limits.md}}), visit the [**Actors**]({{@link actors.md}}) section.

If you're looking to set up recurring events such as actor or task runs, check out the [**Schedules**]({{@link storage.md}}) page.

To execute events during your actor runs, you'll need to set up a [**Webhook**]({{@link webhooks.md}}).

To learn all about how you can store and manage your data, visit the [**Storage**]({{@link storage.md}}) section.

<!-- Add Organization account link here when it's out -->
If you're looking to collaborate on a project or just to share your resources with other Apify users, the [**Access rights**]({{@link access_rights.md}}) page has what you need. There, you can learn about our organization account and the kind of permissions you can grant for your resources.

The [**API reference**]({{@link api.md}}) will guide you through setting up programmatic access to your resources, while the [**JavaScript API client**]({{@link apify_client_js.md}}) will make it a breeze to access the API from any JavaScript/Node.js application.

To reduce blocking from the sites you're trying to scrape, use the [**Apify Proxy**]({{@link proxy.md}}).

And, last but not least, our [**command-line client**]({{@link cli.md}}) will help you to create, develop, run and deploy Apify actors locally.
