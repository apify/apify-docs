# [](#what-is-web-scraping) Web scraping 101

Web scraping is the process of extracting structured information from a web page. Essentially, web scraping automates the process off manually finding and copy/pasting the information on a website you find useful.

In other words, instead of manually visiting each of the 1000 listings for white T-shirts on an e-commerce site and copy-pasting each listing's price, description and seller information, you can create a bot that will do it for you. You can then make your bot return the data in a handy format like JSON, HTML or Excel, so you could process it and use it for your advantage.

While web scraping is a kind of RPA, it focuses on extracting data. [Robotic process automation](https://apify.com/use-cases/rpa) focuses on the other tasks in browsers - everything except for extracting information.

 RPA allows you to handle processes like filling forms or uploading files while you get on with more important tasks. And it's not just boring tasks you can automate. How about [processing your invoices](https://apify.com/katerinahronik/toggl-invoice-download) or automating your sales processes?
