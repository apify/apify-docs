# [](./tasks)Actor Tasks

Actor Tasks help you prepare the configuration of an actor to perform a specific job (think of it as giving your actor a screenplay). Tasks enable you to create multiple configurations for a single Actor and then run the selected configuration directly from the Apify platform, schedule or API.

Tasks can also be set up for actors made by someone else. Just [search the store](https://apify.com/store) to find an actor you want to use and click the try button to create a task from it.

Like any other resource, you can share your actor tasks with other Apify users via the [access rights]({{@link access_rights.md}}) system. See the full list of permissions [here]({{@link access_rights/list_of_permissions.md#actor-task}}).
