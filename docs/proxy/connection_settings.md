The following table shows HTTP proxy connection settings for the Apify Proxy.

|ProxyÂ type|
|--- |

|`proxy.apify.com`|
|`8000`|
|Specifies proxy settings. See [username parameters]({{@link proxy/datacenter_proxy.md#datacenter-proxy--username-params}}) below for details. **Beware that this is not your Apify username!**|
|Proxy password. Your password is displayed on the [Proxy page](https://my.apify.com/proxy) in the app. Also, in Apify actors, it is passed as the `APIFY_PROXY_PASSWORD` environment variable. See [actor documentation]({{@link actor/run.md#run-env-vars}}) for more details.|
|`http://:@proxy.apify.com:8000`|


**WARNING:** All usage of Apify Proxy with your password is charged towards your account. Do not share the password with untrusted parties or use it from insecure networks, because the password is sent unencrypted due to the limitations of the HTTP protocol.
