# [](#troubleshooting) Troubleshooting

[http://proxy.apify.com/](http://proxy.apify.com/)

If the proxy connection is working, the page should look something like this:

![Apify proxy status page]({{@asset proxy/images/proxy-status.webp}})

To test that your requests are proxied and IP addresses are being [rotated]({{@link web_scraping_101/anti_scraping_techniques.md#bypassing-ip-address-based-blocking}}) correctly, open the following API endpoint via the proxy. It shows information about the client IP address.
