# Actors

Actors are serverless cloud programs running on the Apify platform that can perform computing jobs such
as send an email or crawl a website with millions of pages.
They can be started manually, using API or scheduler, and they can be easily integrated with other apps.

A single isolated actor consists of source code and various settings. You can think of an actor as a cloud app or service. The run of an actor is not limited to the lifetime of a single HTTP transaction. It can run for as long as necessary, even forever.

Like any other resource, you can share your actors with other Apify users via the [access rights]({{@link access_rights.md}}) system. See the full list of permissions [here]({{@link access_rights/list_of_permissions.md#actors}}).
