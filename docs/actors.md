# Actors

Actors are serverless cloud programs running on the Apify platform that can perform arbitrary computing jobs such as send an email or crawl a website with millions of pages. They can be started manually, using API or scheduler, and they can be easily integrated with other apps.

A single isolated actor consists of source code and various settings. You can think of an actor as a cloud app or service. Unlike traditional serverless platforms, the run of an actor is not limited to the lifetime of a single HTTP transaction. It can run for as long as necessary, even forever.
