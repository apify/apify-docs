The way to set up configuration of your Apify Actor for simplified usage.

## [](#create-a-task-for-your-actor)Create a Task for your actor

Go to the [Actor](https://my.apify.com/actors) section in the app and open the actor for which you want to create a task. Now you should see a console with the option to run the actor or create a task.

![Run or create Apify task]({{@asset tasks/images/run-or-create-task.png}})

When you click the "Create Task" button, a new task will be created with the input and options copied from the tabs below.

## [](#create-a-task-for-a-public-actor)Create a Task for a public actor

Tasks can also be set up for actors made by someone else. Just [search the store](https://apify.com/store) to find an actor you want to use and click the try button to create a task from it.
