### Create a Task for your actor

Go to the [Actor](https://my.apify.com/actors) section in the app and open the actor for which you want to create a task. Now you should see a console with the option to run the actor or create a task.

When you click the "Create Task" button, a new task will be created with the input and options copied from the tabs below.

### Create a Task for a public actor

Tasks can also be set up for actors made by someone else. Just [search the store](/store) to find an actor you want to use, try it out, and if you like it, you can create a task from it with a single click of a button - the same as for your actor.
