# Scraping Amazon

In our quick chat about modularity, we finished the code for the results page, and added a request for each product to the crawler's **RequestQueue**. Here, we just need to scrape the description, so it shouldn't be too hard:

```JavaScript
// routes.js

// ...

router.addHandler(labels.PRODUCT, async ({ $, crawler, request }) => {
    const { data } = request.userData;

    const element = $('div#productDescription');

    const description = element.text().trim();

    console.log(description); // works!
});
```


Great! But wait, where do we go from here? We need to go to the offers page next and scrape each offer, but how can we do that? Let's take a small break from writing the scraper and open up [Proxyman]({{@link tools/proxyman.md}}) to analyze requests which we might be difficult to find in the network tab, then we'll click the button on the product page that loads up all of the product offers:

![View offers button]({{@asset web_scraping_for_beginners/challenge/images/view-offers-button.webp}})

After clicking this button and checking back in Proxyman, we discovered this link:

> You can find the request below in the network tab just fine, but with Proxyman, it is much easier and fasterdue to the extended filtering options.

```text
https://www.amazon.com/gp/aod/ajax/ref=auto_load_aod?asin=B07ZPKBL9V&pc=dp
```

The `asin` [query parameter](https://branch.io/glossary/query-parameters/) matches up with our product's ASIN, which means we can use this for any product of which we have the ASIN.

Here's what this page looks like:

![View offers page]({{@asset web_scraping_for_beginners/challenge/images/offers-page.webp}})

Wow, that's ugly. But for our scenario, this is really great. When we click the **View offers** button, we usually have to wait for the offers to load and render, which would mean we could have to switch our entire crawler to a **PuppeteerCrawler** or **PlaywrightCrawler**. The data on this page we've just found appears to be loaded statically, which means we can still use CheerioCrawler and keep the scraper as efficient as possible ðŸ˜Ž

> It's totally possible to scrape the same data as this crawler using [Puppeteer or Playwright]({{@link puppeteer_playwright.md}}); however, with this offers link found in Postman, we can follow the same workflow much more quickly with static HTTP requests using CheerioCrawler.

First, we'll create a request for each product's offers page:

```JavaScript
// routes.js

// ...

router.addHandler(labels.PRODUCT, async ({ $, crawler, request }) => {
    const { data } = request.userData;

    const element = $('div#productDescription');

    // Add to the request queue
    await crawler.addRequests([{
        url: `${BASE_URL}/gp/aod/ajax/ref=auto_load_aod?asin=${data.asin}&pc=dp`,
        label: labels.OFFERS,
        userData: {
            data: {
                ...data,
                description: element.text().trim(),
            },
        },
    }]);
});
```

Finally, we can handle the offers in a separate handler:

```JavaScript
// routes.js

router.addHandler(labels.OFFERS, async ({ $, request }) => {
    const { data } = request.userData;

    for (const offer of $('#aod-offer')) {
        const element = $(offer);

        await Dataset.pushData({
            ...data,
            sellerName: element.find('div[id*="soldBy"] a[aria-label]').text().trim(),
            offer: element.find('.a-price .a-offscreen').text().trim(),
        });

    }
});
```

## [](#final-code) Final code

That should be it! Let's just make sure we've all got the same code:

```JavaScript
// constants.js
export const BASE_URL = 'https://www.amazon.com';

export const labels = {
    START: 'START',
    PRODUCT: 'PRODUCT',
    OFFERS: 'OFFERS',
};
```

```JavaScript
// routes.js
import { createCheerioRouter, Dataset } from 'crawlee';
import { BASE_URL, labels } from './constants';

export const router = createCheerioRouter();

router.addHandler(labels.START, async ({ $, crawler, request }) => {
    const { keyword } = request.userData;

    const products = $('div > div[data-asin]:not([data-asin=""])');

    for (const product of products) {
        const element = $(product);
        const titleElement = $(element.find('.a-text-normal[href]'));

        const url = `${BASE_URL}${titleElement.attr('href')}`;

        await crawler.addRequests([
            {
                url,
                label: labels.PRODUCT,
                userData: {
                    data: {
                        title: titleElement.first().text().trim(),
                        asin: element.attr('data-asin'),
                        itemUrl: url,
                        keyword,
                    },
                },
            },
        ]);
    }
});

router.addHandler(labels.PRODUCT, async ({ $, crawler, request }) => {
    const { data } = request.userData;

    const element = $('div#productDescription');

    await crawler.addRequests([
        {
            url: `${BASE_URL}/gp/aod/ajax/ref=auto_load_aod?asin=${data.asin}&pc=dp`,
            label: labels.OFFERS,
            userData: {
                data: {
                    ...data,
                    description: element.text().trim(),
                },
            },
        },
    ]);
});

router.addHandler(labels.OFFERS, async ({ $, request }) => {
    const { data } = request.userData;

    for (const offer of $('#aod-offer')) {
        const element = $(offer);

        await Dataset.pushData({
            ...data,
            sellerName: element.find('div[id*="soldBy"] a[aria-label]').text().trim(),
            offer: element.find('.a-price .a-offscreen').text().trim(),
        });
    }
});
```

```JavaScript
// main.js
import { CheerioCrawler, KeyValueStore, log } from 'crawlee';
import { router } from './routes.js';

// Grab our keyword from the input
const { keyword = 'iphone' } = (await KeyValueStore.getInput()) ?? {};

const crawler = new CheerioCrawler({
    requestHandler: router,
});

// Add our initial requests
await crawler.addRequests([
    {
        // Turn the inputted keyword into a link we can make a request with
        url: `https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=${keyword}`,
        label: 'START',
        userData: {
            keyword,
        },
    },
]);

log.info('Starting the crawl.');
await crawler.run();
log.info('Crawl finished.');
```
