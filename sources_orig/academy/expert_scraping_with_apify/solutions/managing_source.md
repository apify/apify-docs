# Managing source

In the lesson corresponding to this solution, we discussed an extremely important topic: source code management. Though we solved the task right in the lesson, we've still included the quiz answers here.

## [](#quiz-answers) Quiz answers

**Q: Do you have to rebuild an actor each time the source code is changed?**

**A:** Yes. It needs to be built into an image, saved in a registry, and later on run in a container.

**Q: In Git, what is the difference between pushing changes and making a pull request?**

**A:** Pushing changes the remote branch based on the content on the local branch. The pushing of code changes is usually made to a branch parallel to the one you want to eventually push it to.

When creating a pull request, the code is meant to be reviewed, or at least pass all the test suites before being merged into the target branch.

**Q: Based on your knowledge and experience, is the `apify push` command worth using (in your opinion)?**

**A:** The `apify push` command can sometimes be useful when testing ideas; however, it is much more ideal to use Github integration rather than directly pushing to the platform.
