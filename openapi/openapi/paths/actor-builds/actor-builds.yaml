  description: |
    Gets a list of all builds for a user. The response is a JSON array of
    objects, where each object contains basic information about a single build.

    The endpoint supports pagination using the `limit` and `offset` parameters
    and it will not return more than 1000 records.

    By default, the records are sorted by the `startedAt` field in ascending
    order. Therefore, you can use pagination to incrementally fetch all builds while
    new ones are still being started. To sort the records in descending order, use
    the `desc=1` parameter.
