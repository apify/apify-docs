## Social media promotion

### Share on Twitter/X with a demo

Twitter's developer community is active and engaged. A well-crafted tweet with a video demo can reach thousands of potential users.

Create a 30-60 second demo video or gif showing your Actor in action. Include relevant hashtags like #webscraping, #API, #automation, and #buildinpublic.

<PromptButton prompt={TWITTER_POST_PROMPT} title="Prompt" />

### Share on LinkedIn with a demo

LinkedIn reaches professionals, decision-makers, and business users with purchasing power. The platform's algorithm favors native video content, giving it 5x more reach than link posts.

Create a 30-90 second demo video showing your Actor delivering business value. Upload the video directly to LinkedIn (native videos perform better than YouTube links). Focus your post on the business problem solved, not technical features. Use 3-5 relevant hashtags like #BusinessAutomation, #Productivity, #DataIntelligence, #Efficiency, or #MarketResearch.

<PromptButton prompt={LINKEDIN_POST_PROMPT} title="Prompt" />

### Post in relevant Discord and Slack communities

Developer communities on Discord and Slack are where your target users spend time. These platforms enable deeper conversations and direct feedback.

Join communities related to data for AI, web scraping, automation, data science, or your specific niche. Share your Actor in relevant channels, but always check the community rules first. Consider Apify Discord, web scraping communities, automation groups, and data engineering Slacks.

## Video content creation

### Create a tutorial video or walkthrough

Video content ranks well on YouTube and Google. It's perfect for developers who prefer visual learning. Videos get embedded and shared, multiplying your reach.

Record a 5-10 minute screen recording showing your Actor in action. Use Loom, OBS, or your computer's built-in recorder. Distribute your video across multiple channels:

- YouTube
- LinkedIn
- Twitter/X
- Your README and articles

**Video structure:**

1. **Introduction (30-45 seconds)** - Greet viewers, explain the problem you're solving, what they'll learn, and time estimate
2. **Outcome preview (30-45 seconds)** - Show the result first, preview the final output
3. **Step-by-step walkthrough (4-7 minutes)** - Navigate to the Actor, set up configuration, show optional features, run the Actor, review results, export the data
4. **Pro tips (30-60 seconds)** - Share 2-3 quick tips you've learned
5. **Wrap up (30-45 seconds)** - Recap, call-to-action, engagement prompt

**Recording tips:** Close unnecessary tabs, use a clean browser profile, speak clearly at a moderate pace, pause briefly between steps for easier editing, and use your natural voice.

### Create short-form videos (TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels)

Short-form video is one of the fastest-growing content formats with incredible organic reach. Even accounts with zero followers can get thousands of views. These videos showcase your Actor's value in 15-60 seconds and appear in AI-generated answers and search results.

Focus on the "wow factor": show the problem (manual work taking forever) versus the solution (your Actor doing it in seconds). Use trending sounds when possible, add text overlays explaining what's happening (most people watch without sound), and include a clear call-to-action at the end. Post the same video across all three platforms to maximize reach.

:::tip Best practices for short-form videos

- Hook viewers in the first 3 seconds (show the result or problem immediately)
- Keep it fast-paced
- Add captions and text overlays (essential for silent viewing)
- Record in portrait mode (9:16 aspect ratio)
- End with a clear next step: "Link in bio" or "Search [Actor Name] on Apify"

### Cross-post to relevant subreddits

Original posts in relevant subreddits (r/webdev, r/datascience, r/SideProject, r/programming, r/automation) drive significant traffic when done thoughtfully.

Write a Reddit-native post that explains the problem, your solution, and invites feedback. Use titles like "I built X to solve Y" instead of "Check out my new tool." Follow subreddit self-promotion rules (many require you to be an active community member first). Share both challenges and successes to foster authentic engagement.

### Answer Stack Overflow questions

Stack Overflow answers rank well in search and are frequently referenced by AI systems. Providing helpful answers that mention your Actor creates lasting SEO value.

Search for questions related to your Actor's use case (e.g., "web scraping", "API integration"). Provide genuinely helpful answers that solve the problem, and mention your Actor as one potential solution.

### Contribute to Quora discussions

Quora answers rank well in Google and are often featured in AI-generated answers. People actively seek solutions to problems on this platform.

1. Search `site:quora.com [ACTOR NAME]` or related keywords in Google
2. Find relevant Quora threads
3. Write comprehensive, helpful answers and mention your product naturally without being salesy

Write 300-500 word answers that open with a direct response, provide context, offer 2-3 different approaches, mention your Actor as one option, and include personal experience. Use subheadings for readability. Keep tone expert but approachable.
