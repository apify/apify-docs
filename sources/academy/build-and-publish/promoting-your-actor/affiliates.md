## How the program works

The Apify Affiliate Program lets you promote three main offerings:

1. _Apify Store_: recommend Actors from the marketplace that help businesses automate lead generation, pricing intelligence, content aggregation, and more.
1. _Apify platform_: promote the platform's features, including scheduling, monitoring, data export options, proxies, and integrations.
1. _Professional services_: refer customers who need custom web scraping solutions to Apify's Professional Services team and earn up to $2,500 per closed deal.

### Commission structure

- _20% commission_ for the first 3 months of each customer's subscription
- _30% commission_ from month 4 onwards for as long as they remain customers
- _Up to $2,500 per customer_ for professional services referrals
- _No time limits on commissions_ - you earn as long as your referrals stay active

### Free trial advantage

Apify offers a $5 free trial that renews monthly, giving your referrals time to test the tools before subscribing. This increases conversion rates and helps you earn more consistent commissions.

## How to succeed as an affiliate

### Use word of mouth

Tell clients, business contacts, or colleagues how Apify solves their lead generation, data collection, and automation challenges. Personal recommendations are effective, especially when you can speak to real use cases.

### Create educational content

Use your platform to demonstrate value:

- Blog posts: write tutorials, case studies, or problem-solving guides that feature Apify tools
- Video content: record demos, walkthroughs, or quick tips showing how Actors work
- Podcasts: discuss automation workflows and mention specific Actors that solve common problems
- Social media: share favorite Actors, tools, or workflows with your audience

### Engage your community

If you run a forum, Discord server, or an online group, position Apify as a resource for solving automation and data collection challenges. Answer questions and recommend relevant Actors when they fit the problem.

### Teach and inspire

If you teach AI automation, engineering, marketing, or lead generation, include Apify in your curriculum. Show students how to use Actors in webinars, online courses, or workshops.
