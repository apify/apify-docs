**Social media is a powerful way to connect with your Actor users and potential users. Whether your tool focuses on web scraping or automation, social platforms can help you showcase its features, answer user questions, and grow your audience. This guide will show you how to use social media effectively, what to share, and how to avoid common mistakes along the way.**

Now, before we start listing social media platforms, it might be important to acknowledge something.

Developers are notorious for not using social media that much. Or they use social media exclusively in the context of their own interests: that won’t find them new users, but rather colleagues or collaborators.

That's a good start, and maybe it's enough. A developer that can also “do” social media is a unicorn. These are super rare. And if you want to really promote your Actor, you'll need to become that unicorn. Before we start, you need to understand the benefits of this activity.

## Why be active on social media

Engaging with your users on social media offers a lot of benefits beyond just promoting your Actor. Let’s look at some of the main reasons why being active online can be a game-changer for your Actor’s success:

1. Social platforms make it easy to gather real-time feedback and also provide support in real-time. You can quickly learn what users love, what they struggle with, and what features they’d like to see. This can guide your Actor’s future development. It also allows you to build trust and credibility with your audience.
2. Shot in the dark: social media exposes your Actor to new users who might not find you through search engines alone. A shared post or retweet can dramatically expand your reach, helping you grow your user base.
3. Consistent activity on social platforms creates more backlinks to your Actor’s page, which can improve its search engine ranking and drive organic traffic.

## Where to engage: Choosing the right platforms

Choosing the right platforms is key to reaching your target audience. Here's a breakdown of the best places for developers to promote their web scraping and automation tools:

- _Discord_: We started with an easy one. Create a community around your Actor to engage with users directly. Offering quick support and discussing the features of your Actor in a real-time chat setting can lead to deeper user engagement.

    You can also promote your tools through [Apify's Discord](https://discord.com/invite/crawlee-apify-801163717915574323).

    :::

- _Twitter (X)_: Good for short updates, feature announcements, and quick interactions with users. The tech community on Twitter is very active, which makes it a great spot for sharing tips and getting noticed.
- _Reddit_: In theory, subreddits like r/webscraping, r/automation, and r/programming allow you to share expertise, engage in discussions, and present your Actor as a solution. However, in reality, you have to be quite careful with promotion there. Be very mindful of subreddit rules to avoid spamming or over-promoting. For Reddit, personal stories on how you built the tool + a roadblock you might be facing right now are the safest formula. If a tool is already finished and perfected, it will be treated as promotional content. But if you're asking for advice - now that's a community activity.
- _TikTok_: Might not be an obvious choice, but that’s where most young people spend time. They discuss a myriad of topics, laugh at the newest memes, and create trends that take weeks to get to Reels and Shorts. If you want to create educational, fun, short video content (and be among the first to talk about web scraping), this is your place for experiments and taking algorithm guesses.
- _YouTube_: Ideal for tutorials and demos. A visual walk-through of how to use your Actor can attract users who prefer watching videos to reading tutorials or READMEs. It's also good for Shorts and short, funny content.
- _StackOverflow_: While not a traditional social media platform, StackOverflow is a great space to answer technical questions and demonstrate your expertise. Offering help related to web scraping or automation can build credibility, and you can subtly mention your Actor if it directly solves the issue (as long as it adheres to community guidelines).
- _LinkedIn_: If your Actor solves problems for professionals or automates business tasks, LinkedIn is the place to explain how your tool provides value to an industry or business.

## Best practices for promoting your Actor on social media

Now that you know where to engage and why it’s important, here are some best practices to help you make the most of social media:

1. _Offer value beyond promotion_: If you look around, you'll see that the golden rule of social media these days is to educate and entertain. Focus on sharing useful information related to your Actor. Post tips on automation, web scraping techniques, or industry insights that can help your audience. When you do promote your Actor, users will see it as part of a valuable exchange, not just an ad. Besides, constantly posting promotional content turns anybody off.
2. _Post consistently_: The most important rule for social media is to show up. Whether it’s a weekly post about new features or daily tips for using your Actor more effectively, maintaining a regular posting schedule keeps your audience connected.
3. _Visuals matter_: Screenshots, GIFs, and short videos can explain more than text ever could. Show users how your Actor works, the results it scrapes, or how automation saves time.
4. _Widen your reach_: Web scraping is a niche topic. Find ways to talk about it more widely. If you stumble upon ways to relate it to wider topics: news, science, research, even politics and art, use it. Or you can go more technical and talk about various libraries and languages you can use to build it.
5. _Use relevant hashtags_: Hashtags like #webscraping, #automation, #programming, and #IT help you reach a wider audience on platforms like Twitter and TikTok. Stick to a few relevant hashtags per post to avoid clutter.
6. _Engage actively_: Social media is a two-way street. Reply to comments, thank users for sharing your content, create stitches, and answer questions. Building relationships with your users helps foster loyalty and builds a sense of community around your Actor.
7. _Use polls and Q&As_: Interactive content like polls or Q&A sessions can drive engagement. Ask users what features they’d like to see next or run a live Q&A to answer questions about using your Actor. These tools encourage participation and provide valuable insights.
8. _Collaborate with other creators_.

## Caveats to social media engagement

1. _Over-promotion_: Constantly pushing your Actor without offering value can turn users away. Balance your promotional content with educational posts, interesting links, or insights into the development process. Users are more likely to engage when they feel like they’re learning something, rather than just being sold to.
2. _Handling negative feedback_: Social media is a public forum, and not all feedback will be positive. Be prepared to address user concerns or criticism professionally. Responding kindly (or funnily) to criticism shows you’re committed to improving your tool and addressing users' needs.
3. _Managing multiple platforms_: Social media management can be time-consuming, especially if you’re active on multiple platforms. Focus on one or two platforms that matter most to your audience instead of spreading yourself too thin.
4. _Algorithm changes_: Social media platforms often tweak their algorithms, which can impact your content’s visibility. Stay updated on these changes, and adjust your strategy accordingly. If a post doesn’t perform well, experiment with different formats (videos, visuals, polls) to see what resonates with your audience.
5. _Privacy and compliance_: Very important here to be mindful of sharing user data or results, especially if your Actor handles sensitive information. Make sure your posts comply with privacy laws and don’t inadvertently expose any personal data.
