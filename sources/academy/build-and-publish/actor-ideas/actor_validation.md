Before investing time into building an Actor, validate that people actually need it. This guide shows you how to assess market demand using free tools and research techniques.

## Assess your motivation

Ask yourself: _Do you want to build this?_

You'll work on this Actor for a long time. The best Actors come from developers who genuinely care about the problem they're solving. You don't need to be obsessed, but you should feel excited. That enthusiasm carries you through challenges and shows
in your work.

## Estimate demand with SEO data

Check if people are searching for solutions like yours. If your idea aligns with popular search queries, you have a built-in user base.

### Keyword demand

Search for terms related to your Actor's function. If you're building a Reddit sentiment analysis scraper, check volume for phrases like _Reddit data extractor_ or _analyze Reddit comments tool_.

Use free tools:

- [Google Keyword Planner](https://business.google.com/en-all/ad-tools/keyword-planner/)
- [Whatsmyserp](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/whatsmyserp/chbmoagfhnkggnhbjpoonnmhnpjdjdod) Chrome extension
- [Keywords Everywhere](https://keywordseverywhere.com/) (paid)

High search volume or multiple related terms indicate solid demand. Low or zero searches mean a very niche market, which isn't bad, but you'll rely more on direct marketing.

### Google autocomplete and related searches

Type your core keywords into Google and note the suggestions. Typing _scrape Amazon_ might show _scrape Amazon reviews_ or _Amazon price tracker_, confirming what people actually want.

### SEO difficulty and content gaps

Examine current search results. Few quality results for a query like _download data from [obscure site]_ indicates a content gap your Actor can fill.

Many results or ads for _Instagram scraper_ means the market is proven but competitive. You'll need to differentiate.

Check keyword difficulty and domain authority. If difficulty is 70+ and top pages have 80+ domain authority with thousands of backlinks—and Apify already has an official Actor with 100,000+ users—you can't compete directly. Find an adjacent angle or specialization.

## Analyze Google Trends

Google Trends shows if interest in your idea is rising or falling. Declining trends are red flags. If searches dropped 90% over 12+ months (like _Clubhouse scraper_ since 2021), that market has moved on.

Growth velocity matters more than current volume. A keyword growing from 10 to 100 monthly searches over 12 months shows exploding demand. Jump in early, before competition heats up.

Watch for spikes. Sudden jumps from media coverage or viral moments usually don't mean sustainable demand.

## Research community discussions

Beyond SEO data, go where your potential users are. Browse Reddit, Hacker News, Stack Overflow, X (Twitter), Discord, and Facebook groups. What problems are people discussing? What tools do they wish existed?

Document your findings. Note quotes and recurring themes like _Multiple marketers on Reddit want easy competitor pricing tracking—no existing solution mentioned_. These insights complement your SEO data and help you speak your users' language.

Zero discussion across multiple platforms over 4+ weeks means either no one cares about the problem or they've already solved it.

### Reddit

Search relevant subreddits (r/webscraping, r/datascience, r/SEO, r/marketing, or industry-specific ones) for questions like _How can I extract [data] from [site]?_ or _I wish there was a tool to do X_. Multiple people independently asking for the same solution is strong validation.

Use the `site:` parameter in Google to search for relevant threads:

```text

site:reddit.com extracting data from LinkedIn

```

You can also use tools like [F5Bot](https://f5bot.com/) or
[GummySearch](https://gummysearch.com/).

### Q&A forums and Stack Overflow

Look for questions about doing the task manually. If thinking about a LinkedIn scraper, check Stack Overflow for questions like _How can I scrape LinkedIn profiles?_ Frequent questions or upvotes indicate many people trying to solve it without a good tool—an opportunity for your Actor.

Use the `site:` parameter:

```text

site:stackoverflow.com extracting data from LinkedIn

```

### X and social media

Search keywords on X, LinkedIn, or other social media for professionals asking for recommendations like _Does anyone know a tool to monitor news about [topic]?_

Run quick polls or ask your followers if they'd use a tool that does XYZ. A few positive responses validate your idea. Silence means rethink your value proposition. Engaging this way is early marketing.

Use the `site:` parameter:

```text

site:x.com extracting data from LinkedIn

```

### Hacker News and niche forums

Platforms like [Hacker News](news.ycombinator.com) often have discussions on tech pain points and new tool launches. Search for keywords like _scrape Airbnb data_ to see if people have shown interest or if someone launched a similar tool and what the reaction was.

Use the `site:` parameter:

```text

site:news.ycombinator.com extracting data from LinkedIn

```

:::tip Look for spending signals

Current spending patterns are the strongest signal. When users mention "currently paying $X/month for [existing tool] but..." or "upgraded from free to paid plan because..." or specific competitor pricing, they are proven buyers.

You can also engage in communities. Answer related questions, share knowledge, build reputation. Mention your Actor idea casually where relevant: "I'm building a tool to solve exactly this, would you use it?" Track responses. Positive responses with questions about pricing or features mean genuine interest.

## Analyze GitHub repositories

Star counts signal market demand. [Scrapy](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy) has 58,000+, [Crawlee](https://github.com/apify/crawlee) has 20,000+, web scraping is validated. Use the [Star History tool](https://www.star-history.com/) to check if stars are rising (growing momentum) or flat.

Issue analysis reveals pain points your Actor could solve. High issue counts with active responses indicate healthy, used projects. Open issues with themes like _JavaScript rendering problems_ or _CAPTCHA bypass needed_ show gaps you can fill. Issues with 10+ upvotes mean multiple users face the same problem.

Fork and commit activity shows developers actively work with the technology. High fork-to-star ratios mean people are building extensions (evidence of real usage). Recent commits (within 30 days) indicate active maintenance and a healthy project. No commits for 6+ months suggests declining interest.

## Review Product Hunt launches

Study successful automation tool launches from the past 12-24 months on Product Hunt. Filter by _Browser Automation_ and _Automation tools_, then sort by upvotes. Note which taglines, value propositions, and features resonated. Products with 500+ upvotes validated something—figure out what worked.

## Research Apify Store

Apify Store shows transparent competitive intelligence most marketplaces hide. Every Actor displays monthly users, ratings, pricing, and last updates, a data goldmine for what works and what doesn't.

Search your use case or segment thoroughly. List relevant Actors with their metrics: monthly users, ratings, pricing, last update, and creator. Create a feature comparison matrix. Analyze top performers' READMEs, documentation quality, and issues.

Review competitor issues tabs closely. High-quality READMEs with examples and clear value propositions perform better in Store search. Issues reveal unresolved pain points from actual users. If competitors have 20+ open issues with repeated themes, that's your differentiation roadmap.

### Assess market saturation

- 10-30 Actors: healthy competition (market validated, you need differentiation)
- 50+ Actors: saturated (need obvious gaps)
- 1-5 Actors: blue ocean or unproven demand (validate carefully)

If the market has 50+ Actors with strong leaders (Apify-maintained with 50,000+ users) and you can't articulate clear differentiation, pivot. If you spot feature gaps or underserved niches, continue.

## Scan the broader market

Do a general Google search for tools or services that solve your problem. Your competition might not be another Actor—it could be a SaaS tool or API. If your idea is _monitor website uptime and screenshot changes_, established services probably exist.

Note direct competitors: How do they price it? What audience do they target? Are users satisfied or complaining? This validates that people pay for the service and reveals gaps you can fill.

Understanding the competition helps you refine your unique value—whether that's lower cost, better features, or targeting an underserved niche.

No existing solutions? Ask why. You might have found an untapped need, or it's a red flag (too difficult to implement, or the target website aggressively blocks scraping). Use your judgment.

## Get feedback from potential users

Reach out to people who match your target user profile. Building a real estate data Actor? Contact real estate analysts or agents (LinkedIn works well) and ask if a tool that does X would help them. Keep it informal—describe the problem you're solving and ask if they'd use or pay for it.

Direct feedback helps you:

- Validate your assumptions
- Understand pricing expectations
- Identify must-have features
- Refine your value proposition

Track responses carefully. Enthusiasm with specific questions about features or pricing indicates genuine interest. Generic "sounds interesting" responses mean keep validating.
