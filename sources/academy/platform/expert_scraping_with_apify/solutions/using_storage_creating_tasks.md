## Quiz answers 📝 {#quiz-answers}

**Q: What is the relationship between Actors and tasks?**

**A:** Tasks are pre-configured runs of Actors. The configurations of an Actor can be saved as a task so that it doesn't have to be manually configured every single time.

**Q: What are the differences between default (unnamed) and named storage? Which one would you use for everyday usage?**

**A:** Unnamed storage is persisted for only 7 days, while named storage is persisted indefinitely. For everyday usage, it is best to use default unnamed storages unless the data should explicitly be persisted for more than 7 days.

> With named storages, it's easier to verify that you're using the correct store, as they can be referred to by name rather than by an ID.

**Q: What is data retention, and how does it work for all types of storages (default and named)?**

**A:** Default/unnamed storages expire after 7 days unless otherwise specified. Named storages are retained indefinitely.
