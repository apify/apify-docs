**Videos and live streams are powerful tools for connecting with users and potential users, especially when promoting your Actors. You can use them to demonstrate functionality, provide tutorials, or engage with your audience in real time.**

## Why videos and live streams matter

1. Visual engagement. Videos allow you to show rather than just tell. Demonstrating how your Actor works or solving a problem in real time makes the content more engaging and easier to understand. For complex tools, visual explanations can be much more effective than text alone.
2. Enhanced communication. Live streams offer a unique opportunity for direct interaction. You can answer questions, address concerns, and gather immediate feedback from your audience, creating a more dynamic and personal connection.
3. Increased reach. Platforms like YouTube and TikTok have massive user bases, giving you access to a broad audience. Videos can also be shared across various social media channels, extending your reach even further.

## Optimizing videos for SEO

1. Keywords and titles. Use relevant keywords in your video titles and descriptions. For instance, if your Actor is a web scraping tool, include terms like ‚Äúweb scraping tutorial‚Äù or ‚Äúhow to use web scraping tools‚Äù to help users find your content.
2. Engaging thumbnails. Create eye-catching thumbnails that accurately represent the content of your video. Thumbnails are often the first thing users see, so make sure they are visually appealing and relevant.
3. Transcriptions and captions. Adding transcriptions and captions to your videos improves accessibility and can enhance SEO. They allow search engines to index your content more effectively and help users who prefer reading or have hearing impairments.

## YouTube vs. TikTok

1. YouTube. YouTube is an excellent platform for longer, detailed videos. Create a channel dedicated to your Actors and regularly upload content such as tutorials, feature walkthroughs, and industry insights. Utilize YouTube‚Äôs SEO features by optimizing video descriptions, tags, and titles with relevant keywords. Engage with your audience through comments and encourage them to subscribe for updates. Collaborating with other YouTubers or influencers in the tech space can also help grow your channel.
2. TikTok. TikTok is ideal for short, engaging videos. Use it to share quick tips, demo snippets, or behind-the-scenes content about your Actors. The platform‚Äôs algorithm favors high engagement, so create content that‚Äôs catchy and encourages viewers to interact. Use trending hashtags and participate in challenges relevant to your niche to increase visibility. Consistency is key, so post regularly and monitor which types of content resonate most with your audience.

## Growing your channels

1. Regular content. Consistently upload content to keep your audience engaged and attract new viewers. Create a content calendar to plan and maintain a regular posting schedule.
2. Cross-promotion. Share your videos across your social media channels, blogs, and newsletters. This cross-promotion helps drive traffic to your videos and increases your reach.
3. Engage with your audience. Respond to comments and feedback on your videos. Engaging with viewers builds a community around your content and encourages ongoing interaction.
4. Analyze performance. Use analytics tools provided by YouTube and TikTok to track the performance of your videos. Monitor metrics like watch time, engagement rates, and viewer demographics to refine your content strategy.

## Where to mention videos across your Actor ecosystem

1. README: include links to your videos in your Actor‚Äôs README file. For example, if you have a tutorial video, mention it in a "How to scrape X" or "Resources" section to guide users.
2. Input schema: if your Actor‚Äôs input schema includes complex fields, link to a video that explains how to configure these fields. This can be especially helpful for users who prefer visual guides.
3. Social media: share your videos on platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Use engaging snippets or highlights to attract users to watch the full video.
4. Blog posts: embed videos in your blog posts for a richer user experience. If you write a tutorial or feature update, include a video to provide additional context.
5. Webinars and live streams: mention your videos during webinars or live streams. If you‚Äôre covering a topic related to a video you‚Äôve posted, refer to it as a supplemental resource.
