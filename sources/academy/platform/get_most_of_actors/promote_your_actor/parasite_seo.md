**Do you want to attract more users to your Actors? Consider parasite SEO, a non-conventional method of ranking that leverages third-party sites.**

---

Here’s a full definition, from Authority Hackers:

> Parasite SEO involves publishing a quality piece of content on an established, high-authority external site to rank on search engines. This gives you the benefit of the host’s high traffic, boosting your chances for leads and successful conversions. These high DR websites have a lot of authority and trust in the eyes of Google
>

As you can see, you’re leveraging the existing authority of a third-party site where you can publish content promoting your Actors, and the content should rank better and faster as you publish it on an established site.

You can do parasite SEO for free, but you can also pay for guest posts on high-authority sites to post your articles promoting the Actors.

Let’s keep things simple and practical for this guide, so you can start immediately. We will cover only the free options, which should give you enough exposure to get started.

In this guide, we will cover the following sites that you can use for parasite SEO for free:

- Medium
- LinkedIn
- Reddit
- Quora

## Medium

You probably know [Medium](https://medium.com/). But you might not know that Google quite likes Medium, and you have a good chance of ranking high in Google with articles you publish there.

1. You need a Medium account. It’s free and easy to create.
2. Now, you need to do keyword research. Go to [Ahrefs Free Keyword Generator](https://ahrefs.com/keyword-generator/?country=us), enter your main keyword (e.g. Airbnb scraper), and check what keyword has the highest search volume.
3. Search for that keyword in Google. Use incognito mode and a US VPN if you can. Analyze the results and check what type of content you need to create. Is it a how-to guide on how to create an Airbnb scraper? Or is it a list of the best Airbnb scrapers? Or perhaps it’s a review or just a landing page.
4. Now, you should have a good idea of the article you have to write. Write the article and try to mimic the structure of the first results.
5. Once you’re done with the article, don’t forget to include a few calls to action linking to your Actor on Apify Store. Don’t be too pushy, but mention all the benefits of your Actor.
6. Publish the article. Make sure your title and URL have the main keyword and that the main keyword is also in the first paragraph of the article. Also, try to use relevant tags for your Actor.

## LinkedIn Pulse

LinkedIn Pulse is similar to Medium, so we won’t go into too much detail. The entire process is the same as with Medium; the way you publish the article differs.

## Reddit

1. You must have a Reddit account to use to comment in relevant Subreddits.
2. Go to Google and perform this search: `site:reddit.com <your keyword>`, where you replace `<your keyword>` with the main topic of your Actor.
3. Now, list relevant Reddit threads that Google gives you. For an Airbnb scraper, this might be a good thread: [Has anybody have an latest Airbnb scraper code?](https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/m650ol/has_anybody_have_an_latest_airbnb_scraper_code/)
4. To prioritize threads from the list, you can check the traffic they get from Google in [Ahrefs Traffic Checker](https://ahrefs.com/traffic-checker). Just paste the URL, and the tool will give you traffic estimation. You can use this number to prioritize your list. If the volume exceeds 10, it usually has some traffic potential.
5. Now, the last step is to craft a helpful comment that also promotes your Actor. Try to do that subtly. People on Reddit usually don’t like people who promote their stuff, but you should be fine if you’re being genuinely helpful.

## Quora

Quora is similar to Reddit, so again we won’t go into too much detail. The entire process is the same. You just have to use a different search phrase in Google, which is `site:quora.com <your keyword>`.
