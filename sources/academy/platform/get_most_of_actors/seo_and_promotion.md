## Overview

Work on your Actors does not end when you publish it. Now it's the time to promote your creation and get it to its intended audience. The Apify domain will boost your position with search engines but it won't do all the work. Focus on craftin content according to topics and phrases people search for to give your Actor that extra boost.

### SEO fundamentals

Create quality content that provides value and engagement to your users. Search engines evaluate not just keywords, but how users interact with your content. When your content precisely  addresses a specific user needs and visitors actively engage, search engines will naturally boost your rankings. However, over-optimization can lead to penalties, especially if visitors quickjy leave your page.

### Keyword strategy

Start your keyword research using tools like:

- [Wordstream](https://www.wordstream.com/keywords)
- [Ubersuggest](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/)
- [Keyword tool](https://keywordtool.io/)

Target English language searches with a focus on US market. The ideal keywords combine high search volume with manageable competition levels. Incorporate these naturally throughout your content, particularly in titles, description, and body text.

:::warning Keyword stuffing

Google is smart enough to evaluate the page based on how well the whole topic is covered (not only by keywords), but using them helps.
