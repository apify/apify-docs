## What's the Ideas page?

The [Ideas page](https://apify.com/ideas) is where users can submit and explore potential projects for Actors, including scrapers, integrations, and automations. It serves as a collaborative space for proposing new tool ideas and finding inspiration for building and developing web scraping and automation solutions.

## How you, as a developer, can use the Ideas page

Got an innovative Actor idea or unsure what to build next? The Apify Ideas page is your go-to destination for submitting, developing, and claiming Actor concepts. If you're a developer ready to build an Actor using the Apify Ideas page, here’s how you can get involved:

1. _Browse the Ideas page_<br/>
    Check out the [Ideas page](https://apify.com/ideas) to find ideas that interest you. Look for ideas that align with your skills and the kind of Actor you want to build.
2. _Select an idea_<br/>
    Once you’ve found a promising idea, review the details and requirements provided. If you see an idea you want to develop, make sure to check its current status. If it’s marked as **Open to develop**, you’re good to go.
3. _Develop your Actor_<br/>
    Start building your Actor based on the idea. You don’t need to notify Apify about your development process. Focus on creating a functional and well-documented tool.
4. _Prepare for launch_<br/>
    Once your Actor is ready, ensure it meets all quality standards and has a comprehensive README. This documentation should include installation instructions, usage details, and any other relevant information.
5. _Publish your Actor_<br/>
    Deploy your Actor on Apify Store. Make sure it’s live and accessible for users.
6. _Claim your idea_<br/>
    After your Actor is published, email [ideas@apify.com](mailto:ideas@apify.com) with the URL of your Actor and the original idea. This will allow us to tag the idea as Completed and link it to your new Actor, giving you credit and visibility.
7. _Monitor and optimize_<br/>
    Make sure to monitor your Actor’s performance and user feedback. Use this information to make improvements and keep your Actor up to date.

By following these steps, you’ll be able to contribute to the community while also gaining recognition for your work.

## Criteria for claiming an idea

To claim an idea, ensure that:

1. Your Actor is functional.
2. Your README contains relevant information.
3. Your Actor closely aligns with the original idea.

## Giving back to the Ideas page

The Ideas page at Apify offers a variety of concepts for scrapers, integrations, and automations, and is a great place to find inspiration or solutions. It’s also a platform where you can contribute your own ideas to drive innovation and growth in our community.

1. _Submit your Ideas_<br/>
    Got a great Actor concept? Share it with us through the [Ideas form](https://apify.typeform.com/to/BNON8poB#source=ideas). Provide clear details about what your tool should do and how it should work.
2. _Engage with the community_<br/>
    Upvote ideas you find intriguing. The more support an idea receives, the more likely it is to catch a developer’s eye and move forward.
3. _Don’t forget to claim your idea_<br/>
    Once your Actor is up and running, claim your idea by emailing [ideas@apify.com](mailto:ideas@apify.com) with your Actor's URL and the original idea. We’ll mark your idea as **Completed** and link it to your Actor - a signal to the other developers that this tool already exists on Apify Store.

## Multiple developers for one idea

No problem! Apify Store can host multiple Actors with similar functions. However, we go by the “first come - first served” rule, so the first developer to claim an idea will receive the **Completed** tag and a link from the Ideas page.

Remember that Apify Store is just like any other marketplace. We believe that competition helps developers thrive and improve upon their code, especially when there are similar scrapers on the horizon! You can still build the Actor, but try to be imaginative when it comes to its set of features.
