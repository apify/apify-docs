Using emojis in Actors is a science on its own. Learn how emojis enhance the user experience in Actors by grabbing attention, simplifying navigation, and making information clearer.

## On the use of emojis in Actors

We started using emojis in Actors for several reasons. First, tech today often uses emojis to make things look more user-friendly. Second, people don’t read as much as we’d like. You only have a few seconds to grab their attention, and text alone can feel overwhelming. Third, we don’t have many opportunities or space to explain things about Actors, and we want to avoid users needing to open extra tabs or pages. Clarity should come instantly, so we turned to emojis.

When evaluating a new tool, those first 5 seconds are critical. That’s why we use emojis extensively with our Actors. They’re part of the Actor SEO title and description to help the tool stand out in Google results. In READMEs, they serve as shortcuts to different sections and help users quickly understand the type of data they’ll get. In complex input schemas, we rely on emojis to guide users and help them navigate the tool more efficiently.

## Emoji science

Believe it or not, there’s a science to emoji usage. When we use emojis in Actors and related content, we tap into the brain's iconic and working memory. Iconic memory holds information for less than a second - this is unconscious processing, where attributes like color, size, and location are instantly recognized. This part is where emojis guide the person's attention in the sea of text. They signify that something important is here. Emojis help with that immediate first impression and create a sense of clarity.

After that, the brain shifts to working memory, where it combines information into visual chunks. Since we can only hold about 3-4 chunks at once, emojis help reinforce key points, thus reducing cognitive load. Consistent emoji use across the Actor ecosystem ensures users can quickly connect information and not get overwhelmed.

As an example of this whole process, first, the user notices the emojis used in the field titles (pre-attentive processing). They learn to associate the emojis with those titles (attentive processing). Later, when they encounter the same emojis in a README section, they’ll make the connection, making it easier to navigate without drowning in a sea of text.

## Caveats to emojis

1. Don't overuse them and don’t rely on emojis for critical information**.** Emojis should support the text, not replace key explanations or instructions. It's a crutch for concise copywriting, not a universal solution.
2. Use them consistently. Choose one and stick with it across all content: descriptions, parts of input schema, mentions in README, blog posts, etc.
3. Some emojis have multiple meanings, so choose the safest one. It could be general internet knowledge or cultural differences, so make sure the ones you choose won’t confuse or offend users in other markets.
4. Some emojis don’t render well on Windows or older devices. Try to choose the ones that display correctly both on Mac and Windows and mobile platforms. Besides, emoji-heavy content can be harder to interpret for screen readers and accessibility tools. Make sure the information is still clear without the emojis.
5. It's okay not to use them.
