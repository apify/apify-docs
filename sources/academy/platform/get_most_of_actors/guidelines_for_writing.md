# Guidelines for writing tutorials

Create a guide for your users so they can get the best out of your Actor. Make sure your tutorial is both user- and SEO-friendly. Your tutorial will be published on [Apify Blog](https://blog.apify.com/).

---

These guidelines are of course not set in stone. They are here to give you a general direction of tried-and-tested ways of creating an Actor tutorial.

1. **Use markdown formatting.** It might seem like a no-brainer, but it's worth mentioning. Using markdown ensures a smooth transition of your content into our CMS.
2. **Use this structure (also see [the tutorial template](#tutorial-template)):**
    1. Introduce your tool → **What is this X tool for?**
    2. Highlight its unique features → **What data can I scrape with X tool?**
    3. Provide a step-by-step guide, complete with input and output examples → **How to use X tool for scraping X website. Step 1… Step 5.**
    4. Discuss potential use cases → **What are the most frequent use cases of X tool?**
    5. Include a call-to-action (CTA) → **Try this X tool**
    6. Address frequently asked questions (FAQs)

3. **Use SEO tools for keyword research.** Even the best tutorial won't make an impact if it's hidden in the depths of the internet. Use tools like [Answer the Public](https://answerthepublic.com/) to find high-volume, high-cost-per-click keywords related to your topic.
4. **Incorporate relevant links.** While you're writing, look for opportunities to link to other blog posts on the Apify blog that fit well with your topic. Search engines seem to prefer articles that don’t stand alone.
5. **ChatGPT is your friend, but edit wisely.** Feel free to use ChatGPT for generating content, but remember to edit the output. While it's a good tool to get started, it's not perfect and may occasionally make errors.
6. **Additional resources for external writers.** For more details on our tone of voice, image specifications, and other guidelines, visit [Write for Apify](https://apify.com/write-for-apify).
7. After you're done writing, [send your tutorial](mailto:marketing@apify.com) over to one of our writers. They'll take care of it and let you know when it's published.
8. Once your tutorial is published, don't forget to add a link to it to the Actor's README. That way, your tutorial will get its first backlink! It can also be useful for the users skimming through the README in search for detailed instructions.
