Explaining benefits (delegation and independent work, AGENTS.md). Getting environment ready, learning the ropes with a GUI/TUI. Using the `apify` CLI to start a project. Creating a basic scraper which does what we need.

In lesson 3, students would try to make changes via ChatGPT and see that it gets tedious, which leads to introducing an agent-based IDE to work inside the template more comfortably.

The lesson should use Cursor (or Google Antigravity). Only if it truly scales to zero as they claim and it is not required to have a paid account to try an agent. Minimal friction, just install – beats any other decision factors.

If the paragraph above turns out being a wrong direction, we should use VS Code and tell people to spend $10 to try Copilot. VS Code is mainstream. Paying for Copilot is the cheapest agent offering, and it's quite powerful.

#### Installing development environment
Explaining benefits (delegation and independent work, AGENTS.md). Getting environment ready. Use https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/quick-start/build-with-ai
#### Scraping vendor names
Learning the ropes with a GUI/TUI, prompting the agent to update the code so that it scrapes vendor names. Run the program again, get better results.

Teaser: Explain why this is fragile. In the next lesson we'll learn how to develop features of the scraper in a robust way by first specifying them as documentation.
