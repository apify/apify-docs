<!--
#### Creating an Actor
Explain what is Actor. Use Apify CLI template - already provides AGENTS.md, README.md, all the basics. Get the Apify CLI and use it to start a new project. Explain that this is how a professional scraper should be started.
#### Turning the Actor to a scraper
Take contents of the old README to the template and tests and let the agent implement the same scraper again according to all of that. Explain that this is the shortest and most robust way from idea to result - use template, provide docs, tests, and let the agent do its job.
#### Deploying
Deploying to Apify and reaping the benefits of the platform. Running the scraper periodically, getting JSONs and CSVs, seeing history, monitoring, adding support for proxies...
