<!--
Adding fixtures, expectations. Setting up tests and teaching the agent to run tests. Dealing with corner cases by pointing the agent to the fixtures.

In lesson 3, students would try to make changes via ChatGPT and see that it gets tedious, which leads to introducing an agent-based IDE to work inside the template more comfortably.

<!--
#### Creating README.md
Create simple README.md where we document how the scraper behaves, what it produces as an output, etc. Primer to Markdown.
#### Dealing with price intervals
Explain focus on product and domain knowledge. In the README explain how the scraper should handle prices like "From $1,398.00", introduce minPrice, keep prices as numbers, etc.

Let the agent implement handling of variants based on the README. Run updated code, see results.

Teaser: Imagine the target website changes something (happens often!). In such case the README won't help. Let's deal with that.
