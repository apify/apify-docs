<!--
#### Creating tests
Explain tests, expectations. Create test folder, drop downloaded HTML of the listing there, let the agent set up tests around it. Let the agent run tests.
#### Scrape product variants
Change README so that it describes how the product variants should be handled. Drop HTML of the product detail page to the tests folder. Prompt the agent to implement scraping product variants. Run the program, get results.

Teaser: In the next lesson we'll learn how to deploy a similar scraper to a platform, schedule it to run regularly, automatically produce various formats, have a history of data, etc.
