<!-- The homepage menu card items are in the homepage_content.json file.

    Each item has its own JSON object, in which "cardItem" is the title and "href" is the link. If the link leads to outside the Apify Docs site, add the `"isExternalLink" : true` property. For local links, just use the article's path. E.g. `"/tutorials/apify-scrapers/web-scraper"`.

    In the title (cardItem), do not just give the article's name. Phrase the title in a way that answers a question or fulfills a goal the user might have.

    For example:
    {
        "cardItem": "How to run an actor",
        "href": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsidLZKdYWQ",
        "isExternalLink": true
    },

    Note:
    In JSON, all entries except booleans (true/false) and numbers need to be in double quote marks ("").

    Check the README for more information.
