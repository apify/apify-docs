# Quick JavaScript Switcher

**Discover a super simple tool for disabling JavaScript on a certain page to determine how it should be scraped. Great for detecting SPAs.**

**Quick Javascript Switcher** is a very simple Chrome extension that allows you to switch on/off the JavaScript for the current page with one click. It can be added to your browser via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions). After adding it to Chrome, you'll see its respective button next to any other Chrome extensions you might have installed.

If JavaScript is enabled - clicking the button will switch it off and reload the page. The next click will re-enable JavaScript and refresh the page. This extension is useful for checking whether a certain website will work without JavaScript (and thus could be parsed without using a browser with a plain HTTP request) or not.
