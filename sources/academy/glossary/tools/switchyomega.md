SwitchyOmega is a Chrome extension for managing and switching between proxies which can be added in the [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proxy-switchyomega/padekgcemlokbadohgkifijomclgjgif).

After adding it to Chrome, you can see the SwitchyOmega icon somewhere amongst all your other Chrome extension icons. Clicking on it will display a menu, where you can select various differnt connection profiles, as well as open the extension's options.

## Options {#options}

The options page has the following:

- General settings/interface settings (which you can keep to their default values).
- A list of proxy profiles (separate profiles can be added for different proxy groups, or for different countries for the residential proxy group, etc).
- The **New profile** button
- The main section, which shows the selected settings sub-section or selected proxy profile connection settings.
