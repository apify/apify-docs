# What is robotic process automation (RPA)? {#what-is-robotic-process-automation-rpa}

**Learn the basics of robotic process automation. Make your processes on the web and other software more efficient by automating repetitive tasks.**

RPA allows you to create software (also known as **bots**), which can imitate your digital actions. You can program bots to perform repetitive tasks faster, more reliably and more accurately than humans. Plus, they can do these tasks all day, every day.

## What can I use RPA for? {#what-can-i-use-rpa-for}

You can [use](https://apify.com/use-cases/rpa) RPA to automate any repetitive task you perform using software. The tasks can range from [analyzing content](https://apify.com/jakubbalada/content-checker) to monitoring web pages for changes (such as changes in your competitors' pricing).

Other use cases for RPA include filling forms or [uploading files](https://apify.com/lukaskrivka/google-sheets) while you get on with more important tasks. And it's not just simple tasks you can automate. How about [processing your invoices](https://apify.com/katerinahronik/toggl-invoice-download) or posting content across several marketing channels at once?

## How does RPA work? {#how-does-rpa-work}

In a traditional automation workflow, you

1. Break a repetitive process down into [manageable chunks](https://kissflow.com/workflow/workflow-automation/an-8-step-checklist-to-get-your-workflow-ready-for-automation/), e.g. open website => log into website => click button "X" => download section "Y", etc.
2. Program a bot that does each of those chunks.
3. Execute the chunks of code in the right order (or in parallel).

With the advance of [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), it is becoming possible to [record](https://www.nice.com/rpa/rpa-guide/process-recorder-function-in-rpa/) your workflows and analyze which can be automated. However, this technology is still not perfected and at times can even be less practical than the manual process.

## Is RPA the same as web scraping? {#is-rpa-the-same-as-web-scraping}

While [web scraping](../../webscraping/web_scraping_for_beginners/index.md) is a kind of RPA, it focuses on extracting structured data. RPA focuses on the other tasks in browsers - everything except for extracting information.
