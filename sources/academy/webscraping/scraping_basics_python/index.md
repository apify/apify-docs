### Why learn scraping

The internet is full of useful data, but most of them isn't offered in a structured way, easy to process programatically. That's why you need scraping, a set of approaches how to download websites and extract data from them.

Scraper development is also a fun and challenging way to learn web development, web technologies, and understand the internet. You will reverse-engineer websites and understand how they work internally, what technologies they use and how they communicate with their servers. You will also master your chosen programming language and core programming concepts. Understanding web scraping gives you a head start in learning web technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, frontend frameworks (such as React or Next.js), HTTP, REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, and more.

### Why build your own scrapers

Point-and-click or no-code scraping solutions take you only so far. While simple to use, they're not flexible or optimized enough to deal with advanced cases. Those can be tackled only by scrapers - custom-built programs specializing on mining data from the internet. And unlike with ready-made solutions, you can always fine-tune your scraper programs to do more, less, or the same, but faster or cheaper.

### Why become a scraper dev

As a scraper developer you are not limited by the fact if certain data is or isn't available programatically through an official API. The whole web is your API. What you can do with scraping?

- Improve your productivity by building small tools, such as your own real estate or sneakers watchdog.
- Companies can hire you to build custom scrapers mining data important for their business.
- You can publish your scrapers to a platform, such as the [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store), and let others to pay you a rent for using them.

### Why learn with Apify

We are [Apify](https://apify.com), a web scraping and automation platform, but we built this course on top of open source technologies. The skills you will learn are applicable to any scraping project, and you'll be able to run your scrapers on any computer. We will show you how scraping platforms can simplify your life, but those lessons are optional and they're designed to fit into our [free tier](https://apify.com/pricing).
