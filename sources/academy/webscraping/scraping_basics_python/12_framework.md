Caveats which could be addressed in the rewrite:

- all the info in the listing is already at the product page, so it's a bit redundant to scrape the products in the listing, we could just scrape the links

Caveats which are reasons for framework:

- it's slow
- logging
- a lot of boilerplate code
- anti-scraping protection
- browser crawling support
- error handling
