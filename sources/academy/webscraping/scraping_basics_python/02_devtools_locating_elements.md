**In this lesson we'll use the browser tools for developers to manually find products on an e-commerce website.**

In this course, we'll build an app to track prices. It'll scrape product pages from an e-commerce site and record the prices. First, let's check out the site we'll be working with.

## Meeting the Warehouse store

To keep things practical, we won't use artificial scraping playgrounds or sandboxes. Instead, we'll scrape a real e-commerce site. Shopify, a major e-commerce platform, has a demo store at [warehouse-theme-metal.myshopify.com](https://warehouse-theme-metal.myshopify.com/). It strikes a good balance between being realistic and stable enough for a tutorial.

:::info Balancing authenticity and stability

Live sites like Amazon are bulky, packed with promotions, change frequently, and have anti-scraping measures. While those challenges are manageable, they're advanced topics. For this beginner course, we're sticking to a lightweight and stable environment.

However, we deliberately designed all the exercises to work with live websites, even though it means we might need to update them occasionallyâ€”a trade-off we believe is worth it to give you a more authentic learning experience.

Now let's extract some data about the products listed!
