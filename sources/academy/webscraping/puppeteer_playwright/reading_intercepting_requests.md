# Reading & intercepting requests {#reading-intercepting-requests}

**You can use DevTools, but did you know that you can do all the same stuff (plus more) programmatically? Read and intercept requests in Puppeteer/Playwright.**

---

On any website that serves up images, makes [XMLHttpRequests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest), or fetches content in some other way, you can see those requests (and their responses) in the [**Network** tab](../api_scraping/general_api_scraping/locating_and_learning.md) of your browser's DevTools. Lots of data about the request can be found there, such as the headers, payload, and response body.

In Playwright and Puppeteer, it is also possible to read (and even intercept) requests being made on the page - programmatically. This is very useful for things like reading dynamic headers, saving API responses, blocking certain resources, and much more.

During this lesson, we'll be using [Tiësto's following list](https://soundcloud.com/tiesto/following) on SoundCloud to demonstrate request/response reading and interception. Here's our basic setup for opening the page:

<Tabs groupId="main">
<TabItem value="Playwright" label="Playwright">

```javascript
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
const page = await browser.newPage();

// Our code will go here

await page.goto('https://soundcloud.com/tiesto/following');

await page.waitForTimeout(10000);
await browser.close();

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Puppeteer" label="Puppeteer">

```javascript
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';

const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: false });
const page = await browser.newPage();

// Our code will go here

await page.goto('https://soundcloud.com/tiesto/following');

await page.waitForTimeout(10000);
await browser.close();

```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Reading requests {#reading-requests}

We can use the [`page.on()`](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v14.0.0&show=api-event-close) function to listen for the **request** event, passing in a callback function. The first parameter of the passed in callback function is an object representing the request.

Upon visiting Tiësto's following page, we can see in the **Network** tab that a request is made to fetch all of the users which he is following.

![Request to grab Tiësto's following list](./images/tiesto-request.png)

Let's go ahead and listen for this request in our code:

<Tabs groupId="main">
<TabItem value="Playwright" label="Playwright">

```javascript
// Listen for all requests
page.on('request', (req) => {
    // If the URL doesn't include our keyword, ignore it
    if (!req.url().includes('followings')) return;

    console.log('Request for followers was made!')
});

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Puppeteer" label="Puppeteer">

```javascript
// Listen for all requests
page.on('request', (req) => {
    // If the URL doesn't include our keyword, ignore it
    if (!req.url().includes('followings')) return;

    console.log('Request for followers was made!')
});

```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

> Note that you should always define any request reading/interception code prior to calling the `page.goto()` function.

Cool! So now when we run our code, we'll see this logged to the console:

```text
Request for followers was made!
```

This request includes some useful query parameters, namely the `client_id`. Let's go ahead and grab these values from the request URL and print them to the console:

<Tabs groupId="main">
<TabItem value="Playwright" label="Playwright">

```javascript
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
const page = await browser.newPage();

// Listen for all requests
page.on('request', (req) => {
    // If the URL doesn't include our keyword, ignore it
    if (!req.url().includes('followings')) return;

    // Convert the request URL into a URL object
    const url = new URL(req.url());

    // Print the search parameters in object form
    console.log(Object.fromEntries(url.searchParams));
});

await page.goto('https://soundcloud.com/tiesto/following');

await page.waitForTimeout(10000);
await browser.close();

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Puppeteer" label="Puppeteer">

```javascript
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';

const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: false });
const page = await browser.newPage();

// Listen for all requests
page.on('request', (req) => {
    // If the URL doesn't include our keyword, ignore it
    if (!req.url().includes('followings')) return;

    // Convert the request URL into a URL object
    const url = new URL(req.url());

    // Print the search parameters in object form
    console.log(Object.fromEntries(url.searchParams));
});

await page.goto('https://soundcloud.com/tiesto/following');

await page.waitForTimeout(10000);
await browser.close();

```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After running this code, we can see this logged to the console:

```text
{
  client_id: 'llCGDUjKpxUslgO1yEce7Zh95PXE78Bo',
  limit: '12',
  offset: '0',
  linked_partitioning: '1',
  app_version: '1652347025',
  app_locale: 'en'
}
```

## Reading responses {#reading-responses}

Listening for and reading responses is very similar to reading requests. The only difference is that we need to listen for the **response** event instead of **request**. Additionally, the object passed into the callback function represents the response instead of the request.

This time, instead of grabbing the query parameters of the request URL, let's grab hold of the response body and print it to the console in JSON format:

<Tabs groupId="main">
<TabItem value="Playwright" label="Playwright">

```javascript
// Notice that the callback function is now async
page.on('response', async (res) => {
    if (!res.request().url().includes('followings')) return;

    // Grab the response body in JSON format
    try {
        const json = await res.json();
        console.log(json);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('Response wasn't JSON or failed to parse response.')
    }
});

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Puppeteer" label="Puppeteer">

```javascript
// Notice that the callback function is now async
page.on('response', async (res) => {
    if (!res.request().url().includes('followings')) return;

    // Grab the response body in JSON format
    try {
        const json = await res.json();
        console.log(json);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('Response wasn't JSON or failed to parse response.')
    }
});

```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

> Take notice of our usage of a `try...catch` block. This is because if the response is not JSON, the `res.json()` function will fail and throw an error, which we must handle to prevent any unexpected crashes.

Upon running this code, we'll see the API response logged into the console:

![API response in console](./images/api-response-tiesto.png)

## Intercepting requests {#intercepting-requests}

One of the most popular ways of speeding up website loading in Puppeteer and Playwright is by blocking certain resources from loading. These resources are usually CSS files, images, and other miscellaneous resources that aren't super necessary (mainly because the computer doesn't have eyes - it doesn't care how the website looks!).

In Puppeteer, we must first enable request interception with the `page.setRequestInterception()` function. Then, we can check whether or not the request's resource ends with one of our blocked extensions. If so, we'll abort the request. Otherwise, we'll let it continue. All of this logic will still be within the `page.on()` method.

With Playwright, request interception is a bit different. We use the [`page.route()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route) function instead of `page.on()`, passing in a string, regular expression, or a function that will match the URL of the request we'd like to read from. The second parameter is also a callback function, but with the [**Route**](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route) object passed into it instead.

### Blocking resources {#blocking-resources}

We'll first create an array of some file extensions that we'd like to block:

```js
const blockedExtensions = ['.png', '.css', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.pdf', '.svg'];
```

Then, we'll `abort()` all requests that end with any of these extensions.

<Tabs groupId="main">
<TabItem value="Playwright" label="Playwright">

```javascript
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
const page = await browser.newPage();

const blockedExtensions = ['.png', '.css', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.pdf', '.svg'];

// Only listen for requests with one of our blocked extensions
// Abort all matching requests
page.route(`**/*{${blockedExtensions.join(',')}}`, async (route) => route.abort());

await page.goto('https://soundcloud.com/tiesto/following');

await page.waitForTimeout(10000);
await browser.close();

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Puppeteer" label="Puppeteer">

```javascript
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';

const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: false });
const page = await browser.newPage();

const blockedExtensions = ['.png', '.css', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.pdf', '.svg'];

// Enable request interception (skipping this step will result in an error)
await page.setRequestInterception(true);

// Listen for all requests
page.on('request', async (req) => {
    // If the request ends in a blocked extension, abort the request
    if (blockedExtensions.some((str) => req.url().endsWith(str))) return req.abort();
    // Otherwise, continue
    await req.continue();
});

await page.goto('https://soundcloud.com/tiesto/following');

await page.waitForTimeout(10000);
await browser.close();

```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

> You can also use `request.resourceType()` to grab the resource type.

Here's what we see when we run this logic:

![SoundCloud with no CSS or image resources loaded](./images/ugly-soundcloud.png)

This confirms that we've successfully blocked the CSS and image resources from loading.

#### Quick note about resource blocking {#quick-note}

Something **very** important to note is that by using request interception, the browser's cache is turned **off**. This means that resources on websites that would normally be cached (and pulled from the cache instead on the next request for those resources) will not be cached, which can have varying negative effects on performance, especially when making many requests to the same domain, which is very common in web scraping. You can learn how to solve this problem in [this short tutorial](../../tutorials/node_js/caching_responses_in_puppeteer.md)

To block resources, it is better to use a CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) Session ([Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-cdpsession)/[Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v14.1.0&show=api-class-cdpsession)) to set the blocked URLs. Here is an implementation that achieves the same goal as our above example above; however, the browser's cache remains enabled.

<Tabs groupId="main">
<TabItem value="Playwright" label="Playwright">

```javascript
// Note, you can't use CDP session in other browsers!
// Only in Chromium.
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
const page = await browser.newPage();

// Define our blocked extensions
const blockedExtensions = ['.png', '.css', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.pdf', '.svg'];

// Use CDP session to block resources
const client = await page.context().newCDPSession();
await client.send('Network.setBlockedURLs', { urls: blockedExtensions });

await page.goto('https://soundcloud.com/tiesto/following');

await page.waitForTimeout(10000);
await browser.close();

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Puppeteer" label="Puppeteer">

```javascript
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';

const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: false });
const page = await browser.newPage();

// Define our blocked extensions
const blockedExtensions = ['.png', '.css', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.pdf', '.svg'];

// Use CDP session to block resources
await page.client().send('Network.setBlockedURLs', { urls: blockedExtensions });

await page.goto('https://soundcloud.com/tiesto/following');

await page.waitForTimeout(10000);
await browser.close();

```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Modifying the request {#modifyng-the-request}

There's much more to intercepting requests than just aborting them though. We can change the payload, headers, query parameters, and even the base URL.

Let's go ahead and intercept and modify the initial request we fire off with the `page.goto()` by making it go to [Mesto's following page](https://soundcloud.com/mestomusic) instead.

<Tabs groupId="main">
<TabItem value="Playwright" label="Playwright">

```javascript
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
const page = await browser.newPage();

// Only listen for requests matching this regular expression
page.route(/soundcloud.com\/tiesto/, async (route) => {
    // Continue  the route, but replace "tiesto" in the URL with "mestomusic"
    return route.continue({ url: route.request().url().replace('tiesto', 'mestomusic') });
});

await page.goto('https://soundcloud.com/tiesto/following');

await page.waitForTimeout(10000);
await browser.close();

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Puppeteer" label="Puppeteer">

```javascript
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';

const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: false });
const page = await browser.newPage();

await page.setRequestInterception(true);

// Listen for all requests
page.on('request', async (req) => {
    // If it doesn't match, continue the route normally
    if (!/soundcloud.com\/tiesto/.test(req.url())) return req.continue();
    // Otherwise, continue  the route, but replace "tiesto"
    // in the URL with "mestomusic"
    await req.continue({ url: req.url().replace('tiesto', 'mestomusic') });
});

await page.goto('https://soundcloud.com/tiesto/following');

await page.waitForTimeout(10000);
await browser.close();

```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

> Note that this **is not** a redirect, because Tiësto's page was never even visited. The request was changed before it was even fulfilled.

Here's what we see when we run `node index.js`:
