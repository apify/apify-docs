# Puppeteer & Playwright course {#puppeteer-playwright-course}

**Learn in-depth how to use two of the most popular Node.js libraries for controlling a headless browser - Puppeteer and Playwright.**

---

[Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) are libraries that allow you to automate browsing. Based on your instructions, they can open a browser window, load a website, click on links, etc. They can also do this _headlessly_, i.e., in a way that the browser window isn't visible, which is faster.

Both packages were developed by the same team and are very similar, which is why we have combined the Puppeteer course and the Playwright course into one super-course that shows code examples for both technologies. The two differ in only small ways, and those will always be highlighted in the examples.

> Each lesson's activity will contain examples for both libraries, but we recommend using Playwright, as it is newer and has more features and better [documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro)

## Advantages of using a headless browser {#advantages-of-headless-browsers}

When automating a headless browser, you can do a whole lot more in comparison to making HTTP requests for static content. In fact, you can programmatically do pretty much anything a human could do with a browser, such as clicking elements, taking screenshots, typing into text areas, etc.

Additionally, since the requests aren't static, [dynamic content](../../glossary/concepts/dynamic_pages.md) can be rendered and interacted with (or, data from the dynamic content can be scraped).

## Setup {#setup}

For this course, we'll be jumping right into the features of these awesome libraries and expecting you to already have an environment set up. Here's how we set up our environment:

1. Make sure you've installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Create a new folder called **puppeteer-playwright** (or whatever you want to call it)
3. Run the command `npm init -y` within your new folder to automatically initialize the project
4. Add `"type": "module"` to the **package.json** file
5. Create a new file named **index.js**
6. Install the library you're going to be using during this course:

<Tabs groupId="main">
<TabItem value="Install Playwright" label="Install Playwright">

```shell
npm install playwright

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Install Puppeteer" label="Install Puppeteer">

```shell
npm install puppeteer

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

> For a more in-depth guide on how to set up the basic environment we'll be using in this tutorial, check out the [**Computer preparation**](../scraping_basics_javascript/data_extraction/computer_preparation.md) lesson in the **Web scraping for beginners** course
