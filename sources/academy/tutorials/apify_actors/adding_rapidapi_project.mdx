If you've already published an API project on [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/) and want to reach a broader audience, Apify Store and its active user community can help you expand your reach. You can maintain your RapidAPI presence while tapping into the Apify ecosystem.

## Why add your project to Apify?

By publishing your API on Apify, you'll reach thousands of active users in Apify Store. You'll also get access to the Apify platform's infrastructure: managed hosting, data storage, scheduling, advanced web scraping and crawling capabilities, and integrated proxy management. These tools help you reach more users and enhance your API's functionality.

## Step-by-step guide

We'll demonstrate the approach on an app built on top of [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), but with a few adaptations to the code, any API framework will work.

You'll deploy your API as an [Apify Actor](https://apify.com/actors) - a serverless cloud program that runs on the Apify platform. Actors can handle everything from simple automation to running web servers.

### Prerequisites

You’ll need an [Apify account](https://console.apify.com/sign-in) - **it’s free and no credit card is required**. For simple migration and deployment, we recommend installing the Apify CLI:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://apify.com/install-cli.sh | bash
```

:::info Other ways to install the CLI

Check the [CLI installation page](https://docs.apify.com/cli/docs/installation) for more details and all the options.

:::

### Step 1: Initialize the Actor structure

Once you have the Apify CLI, run the following command:

```bash
apify init
```

The command sets up an Actor project in your current directory by creating `actor.json` (Actor configuration) and storage files (Dataset and Key-value store).

### Step 2: Add Actor logic

The initialization of the Actor is the first important thing. The second is the correct mapping of the PORT. Check the following example for inspiration:

```js
await Actor.init(); // Initializes the Actor

const app = express();
const PORT = Actor.config.get('containerPort'); // Specifies the PORT
const DATA_FILE = path.join(__dirname, 'data', 'items.json');

app.use(express.json());

// Rest of the logic
```

**Tip:** The Apify platform performs readiness checks by sending GET requests to `/` with the `x-apify-container-server-readiness-probe` header. For better resource efficiency, consider checking for this header and returning a simple response early, rather than processing it as a full request. This optimization is particularly useful for resource-intensive Actors.

```jsx
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
    if (req.headers['x-apify-container-server-readiness-probe']) {
        console.log('Readiness probe');
        res.send('Hello, readiness probe!\n');
    }
});
```

### Step 3: Test your Actor locally

Once you’ve added the Actor logic, you can test your Actor locally with the following command:

```jsx
apify run
```

Now, you can check that your server is running. For example, check your `/health` endpoint, or any other alternative.

### Step 4: Deploy your Actor to Apify

You can now push your Actor to [Apify Console](https://console.apify.com/) with the following command:

```jsx
apify push
```

If you’re doing `apify push` for the first time, first run `apify login`. It authenticates your Apify account and saves your credentials locally.

### Step 5: Run your Actor

After the deployment of your Actor, you’ll see a similar output in the terminal:

```bash
2025-10-03T07:57:13.671Z ACTOR: Build finished.
Actor build detail https://console.apify.com/actors/a0c...
Actor detail https://console.apify.com/actors/aOcUYdkQ28ResWFF9
Success: Actor was deployed to Apify cloud and built there.
```

You can click the “Actor detail” link, or go to `Apify Console > My Actors`, and click on your Actor. Now, click on the Settings tab, and enable **Actor Standby**:

:::info Actors can run in two modes

Actors can run in two modes: as batch processing jobs that execute a single task and stop, or in **Standby mode** as a web server. For use cases like deploying an API that needs to respond to incoming requests in real-time, Standby mode is the best choice. It keeps your Actor running continuously and ready to handle HTTP requests like a standard web server.

:::

Once you’ve saved the settings, go to the **Standby** tab, and click the **Test endpoint** button. It will start the Actor, and you can test it. Once the Actor is running, you're done with the migration!
