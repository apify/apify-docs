# Apify Platform

> **Apify** is your one-stop shop for web scraping, data extraction, and RPA. Automate anything you can do manually in a browser.
>
> **Actors** are serverless cloud programs running on the Apify platform that can easily crawl websites with millions of pages, but also perform arbitrary computing jobs such as sending emails or data transformations. They can be started manually, using our API or scheduler, and they can be easily integrated with other apps.
