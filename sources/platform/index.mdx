**Apify** is a cloud platform and marketplace for web data extraction and automation tools called *Actors*.

Actors are serverless programs to automate workflows and extract data. Each Actor takes a structured JSON input, performs a task (like web scraping, browser automation, or data processing), and can optionally produce a structured output. Actors are easy to run manually, via API, or on a schedule, and you can combine them into larger automations.

## Getting started

**Learn how to run any Actor in Apify Store or create your own. A step-by-step guides through your first steps on the Apify platform.**
