# Apify platform

> **Apify** is a cloud platform and marketplace of tools for web data extraction and automation.
>
> **Actors** are serverless programs that run in the cloud. They can perform anything from simple actions such as filling out a web form or sending an email, to complex operations such as crawling a website with a million pages, or removing duplicates from a large dataset. Actors can persist their state and be restarted, and thus they can run as short or as long as necessary, from seconds to hours, even infinitely.
