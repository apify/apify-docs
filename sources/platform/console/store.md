Store is a place where you can browse through Actors that have been created and are maintained by Apify, or by members of our community.<br/> There are few ways that can make your browsing experience better:

1. You can use search box on top of the page to search by service (e.g. TikTok, Google, Facebook), or for example by its author.

2. You can browse Actors by predefined categories using the side menu.

3. You can sort results from the store by few different categories like:

* relevance
* popularity
* newest
* recently updated

Choosing any of the Actors in the store will redirect you to it's Actor page. Where you can adjust the settings of your future Actor run and save them for later, or run it immediately.
