## Homepage Overview

![apify-console-homepage](./images/console-homepage.png)

The Apify Console homepage provides an overview of your account setup. The header displays your account name and current plan level. The homepage features several sections:

* **Get Started with Apify**: This section guides you to Apify Store. Here, you can explore existing Actors or create your own. A 'Show me how' button directs you to a guided tour of the Console.

* **Recently Viewed**: This section displays Actors you have recently accessed. New users or those who haven't viewed any Actors will see suggestions instead.

* **Suggested Actors for You**: Based on your and other users' recent activities, this section recommends Actors that might interest you.

* **Actor Runs**: This section is divided into two tabs:
  * **Recent**: View your latest Actor runs.
  * **Scheduled**: Check your upcoming scheduled runs and tasks.

Use the side menu to navigate other parts of the Apify Console easily.
