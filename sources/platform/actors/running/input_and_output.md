**Configure your Actor's input parameters using Apify Console, locally or via API. Access parameters in key-value stores from your Actor's code.**

## Input

Each Actor accepts input, which tells it what it should do. You can run an Actor using the [Apify Console](https://console.apify.com) UI, then configure the input using the autogenerated UI:

![Input UI](./images/input_and_output/actor-input.png)

When running an Actor using the [API](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2) you can pass the same input as the JSON object. In this case, the corresponding JSON input looks as follows:

```json
{
    "maxRequestsPerCrawl": 10,
    "proxy": {
        "useApifyProxy": true
    },
    "startUrl": "https://apify.com"
}
```

## Output

While the input object provides a way to instruct Actors, an Actor can also generate an output, usually stored in its default [dataset](../../storage/dataset), but some additional files might be stored in its [key-value store](../../storage/key-value-store). Always read the Actor's README to learn more about its output.

> For more details about storages, visit the [storage](../../storage/index.md) section.

You can quickly access the Actor's output from the run detail page:

And to access all the data associated with the run, see the **storage** tab, where you can explore the Actor's default [dataset](../../storage/dataset),[key-value store](../../storage/key-value-store), and [request queue](../../storage/request-queue):

> You can also use [API](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2) to retrieve the output. To learn more about this, read the [Run an actor or task and retrieve data via API](../../tutorials/run-actor-and-retrieve-data-via-api) tutorial.
