**Read about the technical part of building Apify Actors. Learn to define actor inputs, build new versions, persist actor state, and choose base Docker images.**

This section will guide you through the whole story of [Actor](../index.mdx) development.

You can follow chapters sequentially from [Quick start](./quick_start/index.mdx), where you learn how to create your first Actor in just a few minutes, through the more technical sections describing the whole Actor model, up to the [Performance](./performance.md) section, where you learn how to fine-tune your Actor to get the most out of the Apify platform.
