**Learn about Actor builds and runs, their lifecycle, versioning, and other properties.**

---

Actor **builds** and **runs** are two main primitives you need to know when you work with the Apify platform. If you take your source code and start building your Actor, you are creating a build. The build is a Docker image containing the source code and required dependencies needed to run the Actor:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph AD [Actor Definition files]
        direction LR
        Dockerfile
        .actor/actor.json
        src/main.js
    end

    AD -- "build process" --> Build
```

If you take your build and start running with some input it, then you are creating a run:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph AD [+]
        direction LR
        Build
        Input
    end

    AD -- "start Actor" --> Run
```

## [](#lifecycle)Lifecycle

Actor builds and runs share their lifecycle. Each build and run starts with the initial status **READY** and goes through one or more transitional statuses to one of the terminal statuses.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Transitional states
        RUNNING
        TIMING-OUT
        ABORTING
    end

    subgraph Terminal states
        SUCCEEDED
        FAILED
        TIMED-OUT
        ABORTED
    end

    READY --> RUNNING
              RUNNING --> SUCCEEDED
              RUNNING --> FAILED
              RUNNING --> TIMING-OUT --> TIMED-OUT
              RUNNING --> ABORTING --> ABORTED
```

| Status     | Type         | Description                                 |
|------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| READY      | initial      | Started but not allocated to any worker yet |
| RUNNING    | transitional | Executing on a worker machine               |
| SUCCEEDED  | terminal     | Finished successfully                       |
| FAILED     | terminal     | Run failed                                  |
| TIMING-OUT | transitional | Timing out now                              |
| TIMED-OUT  | terminal     | Timed out                                   |
| ABORTING   | transitional | Being aborted by user                       |
| ABORTED    | terminal     | Aborted by user                             |
