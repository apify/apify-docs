# Developement quick start

**Create you first actor using Apify Console IDE or locally.**

---

> Before you start building your own Actor, try out a couple of existing Actors from [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store). See the [running actors](../../running/index.md) section for more information on running existing actors.


## Language

Any code that can run inside of an Docker container can be turned into Apify [Actor](../../index.mdx). This gives you freedom in choosing your technical stack including programming language and technologies.

**But to fully benefit from running on the top of the Apify platform we recommend you to choose either Javascript/Node.js or Python where Apify provides you with the first level support in terms of its SDK, API clients, and learning materials.
**

For these languages you can also choose from many code templates that help you to kickstart your project quickly:

## [](#local-development)Local development

There are two ways how to create an Actor:

- Using the **Web IDE** in [Apify Console](https://console.apify.com). This is the fastest way to kick-start your Actor development and try out the Apify platform.
- Develop your Actor **locally** and only deploy to the Apify platform when it is production ready. This way, you benefit from your local setup for a better development and debugging experience. After you are done with the development you can easily [deploy](./deployment) you actor to Apify platform.

Now, let's jump on and start with:

import Card from "@site/src/components/Card";
import CardGrid from "@site/src/components/CardGrid";

<CardGrid>
    <Card
        title="Apify Console web IDE"
        to="/platform/actors/development/quick-start/web-ide"
    />
    <Card
        title="Locally on your machine"
        to="/platform/actors/development/quick-start/locally"
    />
</CardGrid>
