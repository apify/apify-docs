**Use Actors as an API server for fast response times.**

---

Traditional Actors are designed to run a single task and then stop. They're mostly intended for batch jobs, such as when you need to perform a large scrape or data processing task.
However, in some applications, waiting for an Actor to start is not an option. Actor Standby mode solves this problem by letting you have the Actor ready
in the background, waiting for the incoming HTTP requests. In a sense, the Actor behaves like a real-time web server or standard API server.

## Developing Actors using Standby mode

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

The best way to start developing Standby Actors is to use the predefined templates in the [Console UI](https://console.apify.com/actors/templates) or in [CLI](https://docs.apify.com/cli/) via `apify create`. The templates contain minimal code to get you up to speed for development in JavaScript, TypeScript or Python. Standby mode will automatically be enabled with default settings.

If you already have an existing Actor, or you just want to tweak the configuration of Standby mode, you can head to the Settings tab of your Actor, where the Actor Standby settings are located.

Actors using Standby mode must run a HTTP server listening on a specific port. The user requests will then be proxied to the HTTP server. You can use any of the existing [HTTP request methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. You can pass the input via [HTTP request query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) or via [HTTP request body](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages#body).

Sometimes, you want the HTTP server to listen on a specific port and cannot change it yourself. You can use `ACTOR_WEB_SERVER_PORT` environment variable to override the port so that Actor Standby will work with your code.

You can get the port using the Actor configuration available in Apify SDK.
See example below with a simple Actor using Standby mode.

<Tabs groupId="main">
<TabItem value="JavaScript" label="JavaScript">

```js
import http from 'http';
import { Actor } from 'apify';

await Actor.init();

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end('Hello from Actor Standby!\n');
});

server.listen(Actor.config.get('containerPort'));
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python" label="Python">

```python
from http.server import HTTPServer, SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
from apify import Actor

class GetHandler(SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(b'Hello from Actor Standby!')

async def main() -> None:
    async with Actor:
        with HTTPServer(('', Actor.config.web_server_port), GetHandler) as http_server:
            http_server.serve_forever()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Please make sure to describe your Actors, their endpoints, and the schema for their
inputs and outputs in your README.

## Determining an Actor is started in Standby

Actors that support Actor Standby can still be started in standard mode, for example from the Console or via the API.
To find out in which mode was the Actor started, you can read the `metaOrigin` option in `Actor.config`, or the `APIFY_META_ORIGIN` environment variable in case you're not using the Apify SDK.
If it is equal to `STANDBY`, the Actor was started in Standby mode, otherwise it was started in standard mode.

<Tabs groupId="main">
<TabItem value="JavaScript" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { Actor } from 'apify';

await Actor.init();

if (Actor.config.get('metaOrigin') === 'STANDBY') {
    // Start your Standby server here
} else {
    // Perform the standard Actor operations here
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python" label="Python">

```python
from apify import Actor

async def main() -> None:
    async with Actor:
        if Actor.config.meta_origin == 'STANDBY':
            # Start your Standby server here
        else:
            # Perform the standard Actor operations here
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Getting the URL of the Standby Actor

The URL is exposed as an environment variable `ACTOR_STANDBY_URL`. You can also use `Actor.config`, where the `standbyUrl` option is available.

## Monetization of Actors with the Standby mode?

Currently, the Standby mode is in beta, and monetization is not supported. But we plan to enable it soon.
