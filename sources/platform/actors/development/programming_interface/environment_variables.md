# Environment variables {#environment-variables}

**Learn how to provide your Actor with context that determines its behavior through a plethora of pre-defined environment variables offered by the Apify SDK.**

---

## System environment variables

The Actor's process has several environment variables set to provide it with context:

| Environment Variable               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Dates are always in the UTC timezone and are represented in simplified extended ISO format ([ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)), e.g. **2022-07-13T14:23:37.281Z**.

To access environment variables in Node.js, use the `process.env` object, for example:

```js
console.log(process.env.APIFY_USER_ID);
```

To access environment variables in Python, use the `os.environ` dictionary, for example:

```python
import os
print(os.environ['APIFY_USER_ID'])
```

For convenience, rather than using environment vars directly, we provide a `Configuration` class
that allows reading and updating the Actor configuration.

```javascript
const token = Actor.config.get('token');

// use different token
Actor.config.set('token', 's0m3n3wt0k3n')
```

## [](#custom-environment-variables)Custom environment variables

The Actor owner can specify custom environment variables that are set to the Actor's process during the run. Sensitive environment variables such as passwords or API tokens can be protected by setting the **Secret** option. With this option enabled, the value of the environment variable is encrypted, and it will not be visible in the app or APIs. In addition, the value is redacted from Actor logs to avoid the accidental leakage of sensitive data.

![Custom environment variables](./images/environment-vatiables-source.png)

Note that the custom environment variables are fixed during the build of the Actor and cannot be changed later. See the [Builds](../builds_and_runs/builds.md) section for details.

To access environment variables in Node.js, use the `process.env` object, for example:

```js
console.log(process.env.SMTP_HOST);
```

The Actor runtime sets additional environment variables for the Actor process during the run. See [Environment variables](./environment_variables.md) for details.

The environment variables can also be used for the build process. In this case, the variables are treated as [Docker build arguments](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg). This means that they should not be used for secrets and, in order to access them in Dockerfile, you have to use the `ARG variable_name` instruction.
