# Environment variables in Apify

**Learn how to provide your Actor with context that determines its behavior through a plethora of pre-defined environment variables offered by the Apify SDK.**

## System environment variables

Apify sets several system environment variables for each Actor run. These variables provide essential context and information about the Actor's execution environment.

Here's a table of key system environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `ACTOR_ID` | ID of the Actor. |
| `ACTOR_RUN_ID` | ID of the Actor run. |
| `ACTOR_BUILD_ID` | ID of the Actor build used in the run. |
| `ACTOR_BUILD_NUMBER` | Build number of the Actor build used in the run. |
| `ACTOR_TASK_ID` | ID of the Actor task. Empty if Actor is run outside of any task, e.g. directly using the API. |
| `ACTOR_EVENTS_WEBSOCKET_URL` | Websocket URL where Actor may listen for [events](/platform/actors/development/programming-interface/system-events) from Actor platform. |
| `ACTOR_DEFAULT_DATASET_ID` | Unique identifier for the default dataset associated with the current Actor run. |
| `ACTOR_DEFAULT_KEY_VALUE_STORE_ID` | Unique identifier for the default key-value store associated with the current Actor run. |
| `ACTOR_DEFAULT_REQUEST_QUEUE_ID` | Unique identifier for the default request queue associated with the current Actor run. |
| `ACTOR_INPUT_KEY` | Key of the record in the default key-value store that holds the [Actor input](/platform/actors/running/input-and-output#input).  |
| `ACTOR_MAX_PAID_DATASET_ITEMS` | For paid-per-result Actors, the user-set limit on returned results. Do not exceed this limit. |
| `APIFY_HEADLESS` | If **1**, web browsers inside the Actor should run in headless mode (no windowing system available). |
| `APIFY_IS_AT_HOME` | Contains **1** if the Actor is running on Apify servers. |
| `ACTOR_MEMORY_MBYTES` | Size of memory allocated for the Actor run, in megabytes. Can be used to optimize memory usage or finetuning of low-level external libraries. |
| `APIFY_PROXY_PASSWORD` | Password for accessing Apify Proxy services. This password enables the Actor to utilize proxy servers on behalf of the user who initiated the Actor run. |
| `APIFY_PROXY_PORT` | TCP port number to be used for connecting to the Apify Proxy. |
| `APIFY_PROXY_STATUS_URL` | URL for retrieving proxy status information. Appending `?format=json` to this URL returns the data in JSON format for programmatic processing. |
| `ACTOR_STANDBY_URL` | URL for accessing web servers of Actor runs in the [Actor Standby](/platform/actors/development/programming-interface/standby) mode. |
| `ACTOR_STARTED_AT` | Date when the Actor was started. |
| `ACTOR_TIMEOUT_AT` | Date when the Actor will time out. |
| `APIFY_TOKEN` | API token of the user who started the Actor. |
| `APIFY_USER_ID` | ID of the user who started the Actor. May differ from the Actor owner. |
| `ACTOR_WEB_SERVER_PORT` | TCP port for the Actor to start an HTTP server on. This server can be used to receive external messages or expose monitoring and control interfaces. The server also receives messages from the [Actor Standby](/platform/actors/development/programming-interface/standby) mode. |
| `ACTOR_WEB_SERVER_URL` | Unique public URL for accessing the Actor run web server from the outside world. |
| `APIFY_API_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | Public URL of the Apify API. May be used to interact with the platform programmatically. Typically set to `api.apify.com`. |
| `APIFY_DEDICATED_CPUS` | Number of CPU cores reserved for the actor, based on allocated memory. |
| `APIFY_DISABLE_OUTDATED_WARNING` | Controls the display of outdated version warnings. Set to `1` to suppress notifications about updates. |
| `APIFY_WORKFLOW_KEY` | Identifier used for grouping related runs and API calls together. |
| `APIFY_META_ORIGIN` | Specifies how an Actor run was started. Possible values are [here](/platform/actors/running/runs-and-builds#origin) |
| `APIFY_SDK_LATEST_VERSION` | Specifies the most recent release version of the Apify SDK for Javascript. Used for checking for updates. |
| `APIFY_INPUT_SECRETS_KEY_FILE` | Path to the secret key used to decrypt [Secret inputs](/platform/actors/development/actor-definition/input-schema/secret-input). |
| `APIFY_INPUT_SECRETS_KEY_PASSPHRASE` | Passphrase for the input secret key specified in `APIFY_INPUT_SECRETS_KEY_FILE`. |


<!-- vale Microsoft.RangeFormat = NO -->

:::note Date format

All date-related variables use the UTC timezone and are in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (e.g., _2022-07-13T14:23:37.281Z_).

## Access environment variables

You can access environment variables in your code as follows:

<Tabs groupId="main">
<TabItem value="JavaScript" label="JavaScript">

In Node.js, use the `process.env` object:

```js
console.log(process.env.APIFY_USER_ID);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python" label="Python">

In Python, use the `os.environ` dictionary:

```python
import os
print(os.environ['APIFY_USER_ID'])
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Use the `Configuration` class

For more convenient access to Actor configuration, use the [`Configuration`](/sdk/js/reference/class/Configuration) class

<Tabs groupId="main">
<TabItem value="JavaScript" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { Actor } from 'apify';

await Actor.init();

// get current token
const token = Actor.config.get('token');
// use different token
Actor.config.set('token', 's0m3n3wt0k3n');

await Actor.exit();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python" label="Python">

```python
from apify import Actor

async def main():
    async with Actor:
        old_token = Actor.config.token
        Actor.log.info(f'old_token = {old_token}')

        # use different token
        Actor.config.token = 's0m3n3wt0k3n'

        new_token = Actor.config.token
        Actor.log.info(f'new_token = {new_token}')
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Custom environment variables

Actor owners can define custom environment variables to pass additional configuration to their Actors. To set custom variables:

1. Go to your Actor's **Source** page in the Apify Console

1. Navigate to the **Environment variables** section.

1. Add your custom variables.

For sensitive data like API keys or passwords, enable the **Secret** option. This encrypt the value and redacts it from logs to prevent accidental exposure.

:::info Build-time variables

Custom environment variables are set during the Actor's build process and cannot be changed for existing builds. For more information, check out the [Builds](../builds_and_runs/builds.md) page.

:::

## Build-time environment variables

You can also use environment variables during the Actor's build process. In this case, they function as Docker build arguments. To use them in your Dockerfile, include `ARG` instruction:

```docker
ARG MY_BUILD_VARIABLE
RUN echo $MY_BUILD_VARIABLE
```

:::caution Insecure build variables

Build-time environment variables are not suitable for secrets, as they are not encrypted.

:::

By leveraging environment variables effectively, you can create more flexible and configurable Actors that adapt to different execution contexts and user requirements.
