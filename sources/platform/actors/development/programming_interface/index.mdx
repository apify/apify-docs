This chapter will guide you through all the commands you need to build your first Actor. This interface is provided by Apify SDKs for [Node.js](/sdk/js/) and [Python](/sdk/python). The chapter starts with basic commands and guides you through system events and environment variables that are available to your Actor both locally and when running on Apify platform.
