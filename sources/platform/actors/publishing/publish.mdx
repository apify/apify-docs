**Prepare your Actor for Apify Store with a description and README file, and learn how to make your Actor available to the public.**

---

Before making your Actor public, it's important to ensure your Actor has a clear **Description** and comprehensive **README** section. This will help users understand your Actor's purpose, how to configure its inputs, and the type of output it generates. This guide we'll review the essential fields you must complete before publishing your Actor.

## Make your Actor public

Once you've finished coding and testing your Actor, it's time to publish it. Follow these steps:

1. From your Actor's page in the Apify Console, go to **Publication** > **Display information**
2. Fill in all the relevaent fields for your Actor (e.g., **Icon**, **Actor name**, **Description**, **Categories**)
3. Save your changes

To verity that your Actor has been published successfully, go to the [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store), search for your Actor's name. Click on your Actor's card, to view its dedicated page. This is the page where users will likely have their first interaction with your ACtor, so carefully review it and ensure everything is set up correctly.

### Logo

We strongly recommend adding a unique image to your Actor that visually represents the service it provides. This helps users quickly understand its purpose. However, do not use official logos or branded images from the sites you're scraping, as this can lead to copyright or trademark issues.

### Description

The Actor's description is a short paragraph that explains its purpose. It will be displayed on the Actor's page, right below its title.

When writing your Actor's description, you also have the option to provide an SEO title & description. These will be used in search engine result pages instead of Actor's name & description. Effective SEO titles & descriptions should:

- Utilize popular keywords related to your Actor's functionality
- Summarize the Actor's purpose concisely
- Be between _40_ to _50_ characters for the title and _140_ to _156_ characters for description

### README

The next step is to include a comprehensive **README** detailing your Actor's features, reasons for scraping the target website, and instructions on how to use the Actor effectively.

Remember that the Actor's README is generated from your `README.md` file, and you can apply the same [SEO principles](https://apify.notion.site/SEO-990259fe88a84fd0a85ce6d3b394d8c1) mentioned earlier to optimize you README for search engines.

To save time when writing your Actor's README, you can use the following template as a starting point:

Note that the complexity of your README should match the complexity of your Actor. Feel free to adapt the template to fit your Actor's specific requirements.
