> Sharing is caring but you can also make money from your Actors. Check out our [blog post](https://blog.apify.com/make-regular-passive-income-developing-web-automation-actors-b0392278d085/) for more context.


## Publish process

To build & publish an Actor on [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store), you'll go through the following main stages:

1. [Development](../development/index.md).
2. [Publication](./publishing/publish) and set up of [monetization](./publishing/monetize).
3. [Testing](../development/automated_tests.md).
4. [Promotion](../../academy/get-most-of-actors/seo-and-promotion).

## Benefits of publishing and monetization

Publishing your Actor on the Apify Store transforms your code into a sustainable revenue stream while eliminating traditional SaaS development overhead. When you publish your Actor, you automatically receive:

- A dedicated landing page showcasing your Actor's capabilities
- Built-in documentation hosting through README integration
- Direct exposure to organic user traffic
- Flexible sharing options with public or private source code settings
- Complete API documentation and integration examples

### Monetization options

The platform supports various pricing models to match your Actor's value proposition:

- Fixed rental fee for continuous access
- Pay-per-result for usage-based pricing
- Pay-per-event pricing for specific operations
- Custom pricing strategies for enterprise clients

## Maintain public Actors

While private Actors don't necessarily require ongoing maintenance, public Actors demand a highres level of resonsibility. Since public Actors are available on the [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store) and may be used by other users, an unmaintained public Actor could negatively impact those who depend on it.

To ensure long-term quality and improve your chances of successfully monetizing your Actors, we recommend reserving approximately 2 hours per week for maintenance tasks, such as:

- Addressing bug reports & issues
- Implementing updates & improvements
- Responding to user inquireies & feedback

If you decide to make your Actor's code publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com), code quality becomes even more crucial, as your Actor may be the first experience some users have with Apify.

### Handling breaking changes

While refactoring and updating your Actor's code is encouraged, be cautious of making changes that could break the Actor for existing users. If you plan to introduce breaking change, please contact us at [community@apify.com](mailto:community@apify.com) beforehand, and we'll assist you in communicating the change to your users.

### Documentation and testing

Pay special attention to your Actor's documentation ([README](../../academy/get-most-of-actors/actor-readme)). It should be clear, detailed, concise and, readable, using simple language and avoiding technical jargon whenever possible, as your users may not be developers.

Ensure periodic testing, either manually or by [setting up automatic testing](../development/automated_tests.md) and [monitoring](https://apify.com/apify/monitoring). This can help prevent users from encountering issues with your Actor.
