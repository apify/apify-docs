> Sharing is caring but you can also make money from your Actors. Our [blog post](https://blog.apify.com/make-regular-passive-income-developing-web-automation-actors-b0392278d085/) contains all the information you need.


## Publish process

To build & publish a public Actor on Apify platform, you'll go through the following main stages:

1. [Development](../development/index.md).
2. [Publication](./publishing/publish) and set up of [monetization](./publishing/monetize).
3. [Testing](../development/automated_tests.md).
4. [Promotion](../../academy/get-most-of-actors/seo-and-promotion).

## Maintain public Actors

While private Actors don't necessarily require ongoin maintenance, public Actors demand a highres level of resonsibility. Since public Actors are available on the [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store) and may be used by other users, an unmaintained public Actor could negatively impact those who depend on it.

To ensure long-term quality and improve your chances of successfully monetizing your Actors, we rocemmend reserving approximately 2 hours per week for maintenance tasks, such as:

- Addressing bug reports & issues
- Implementing updates & improvements
- Responding to user inquireies & feedback

If you decide to make your Actor's code publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com), code quality becomes even more crucial, as your Actor may be the first experience some users have with Apify.

### Handling breaking changes

While refactoring and updating your Actor's code is encouraged, be cautious of making changes that could break the Actor for existing users. If you plan to introduce breaking change, please contact us at [community@apify.com](mailto:community@apify.com) beforehand, and we'll assist you in communicating the change to your users.

### Documentatino and testing

Pay special attention to your Actor's documentation ([README](../../academy/get-most-of-actors/actor-readme)). It should be clear, detailed and readable, using simple language and avoiding technical jargon whenever possible, as your users may not be developers.

Ensure periodic testing, either manually or by [setting up automatic testing](../development/automated_tests.md) and [monitoring](https://apify.com/apify/monitoring). This can help prevent users from encountering issues with your Actor.
