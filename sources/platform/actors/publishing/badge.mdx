## Actor status badge example

This is the badge generated for the [Apify's Website Content Crawler](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler) Actor.

[![Website Content Crawler Actor](https://apify.com/actor-badge?actor=apify/website-content-crawler)](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler)


### How to embed the Actor Status Badge

The Badge is a dynamic SVG image loaded from the Apify platform. The Badge is served from the URL Template:

```text
https://apify.com/actor-badge?actor=:username/:actor-name
```

In order to embed the badge in the HTML documentation, just use it as an image wrapped in a link as shown in the example below. Don't froget to use the `username` and `actor-name` of your Actor.

#### Example
<!-- vale off -->
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="html" label="HTML Example" default>
    ```html
    <a href="https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler">
      <img src="https://apify.com/actor-badge?actor=apify/website-content-crawler">
    </a>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="markdown" label="Markdown Example">  
    ```markdown
    [![Website Content Crawler Actor](https://apify.com/actor-badge?actor=apify/website-content-crawler\)](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler)
