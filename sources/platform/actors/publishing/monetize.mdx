**Learn how you can monetize your web scraping and automation projects by publishing and renting actors to users in Apify Store.**

---

When publishing your actor on the Apify platform you have the choice to make it a **Paid Actor** and get paid by the users benefiting from your tool.

## Pricing models

All Actors in [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store) fall into one of these three pricing models:

1. **free** - you can run the Actor freely, and you only pay for platform usage the Actor generates.
2. **paid** - same as free, but in order to be able to run the Actor after the trial period, you need to rent it from the developer and pay a flat monthly fee on the top of the platform usage that the Actor generates.
3. **paid per result** - you do not pay for the platform usage that the Actor generates but only for the results it produces.

## Where to start
