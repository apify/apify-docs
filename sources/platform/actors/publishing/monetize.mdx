Apify Store allows you to monetize your web scraping and automation projects by publishing them as Paid Actors. This guide explains the available pricing models and how to get started.

## Pricing models

Actors in the Apify Store can be published under one of the following pricing models:

1. **Free**: Userc can run the Actor without any additional charges beyond the platform usage costs generated by the Actor
2. **Rental**: Similar to the free model, users pay for the platform usage costs. However, after a trial period, they need to pay a flat monthly fee to the develop to continue using the Actor
3. **Paid per Result**: Users don't pay for the platform usage costs. Instead, they pay the developer based on the number of results produced by the Actor.
4. **Paid per Event**: Users don't pay for the platform usage cost the Actor generates. Instead, they pay based on specific events defined by the developer, such as generating a single result or initiating the Actor.

## Where to start

To monetize your Actor, follow the step-by-step guide in the [Apify Academy: Monetizing Your Actor](https://docs.apify.com/academy/get-most-of-actors/monetizing-your-actor). This guide covers the process of setting up pricing, configuring billing, and publishing your Paid Actor to the Apify Store.
