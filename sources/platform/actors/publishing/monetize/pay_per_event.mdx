The pay-per-event pricing model offers a flexible monetization option for Actors on Apify Store. Unlike pay per result, PPE allows you to charge users based on specific events triggered programmatically by your Actor's code.

PPE lets you define pricing for individual events. You can charge for specific events directly from your Actor by calling the [PPE charging API](/api/v2/post-charge-run), or through [JS](/sdk/js/reference/class/Actor#charge)/[Python](/sdk/python/reference/class/Actor#charge) SDK Common events include Actor start, dataset item creation, and external API calls.

## How is profit computed

Your profit is calculated from the mentioned formula:

`profit = (0.8 * revenue) - platform costs`

where:

- _Revenue_: The amount charged for events via the PPE charging API or through JS/Python SDK. You receive 80% of this revenue.
- _Platform costs_: The underlying platform usage costs for running the Actor, calculated in the same way as for PPR. For more details, visit the [Computing your costs for PPE and PPR Actors](#computing-your-costs-for-ppe-and-ppr-actors) section.

Only revenue and cost for Apify customers on paid plans are taken into consideration when computing your profit. Users on free plans are not reflected there.

:::note Negative profit isolation

An Actor's negative net profit does not affect the positive profit of another Actor. For aggregation purposes, any Actor with a negative net profit is considered to have a profit of $0.

- _Previously:_ `Total Profit = (-$90) + $100 = $10`
- _Now:_ `Total Profit = $0 + $100 = $100`

:::

## How to set pricing for pay-per-event Actors

1. _Understand your costs_: Analyze resource usage (e.g CPU, memory, proxies, external APIs) and identify cost drivers
1. _Define clear events_: break your Actor's functionality into measurable, chargeable events.
1. _Common use cases_:
   1. _For scraping_: combine Actor start and dataset items pricing to reflect setup and per-result cost.
   1. _Beyond scraping_: Account for integrations with external systems or external API calls.
1. _External API costs_: Account for additional processing costs.
1. _Test your pricing_: Run your Actor and analyze cost-effectiveness using a special dataset.
1. _Communicate value_: Ensure pricing reflects the value provided and is competitive.

## Best practices for pay-per-event Actors

Use our SDKs (JS and, Python or use [`apify actor charge`](/cli/docs/next/reference#apify-actor-charge-eventname) when using our Apify CLI) to simplify PPE implementation into your Actor. This tool can handle pricing, usage tracking, idempotency keys, API errors, and, event charging via an API.

You can also choose not to use it, but then you must handle API integration and possible edge cases manually.

### Set memory limits

Set memory limits using `minMemoryMbytes` and `maxMemoryMbytes` in your [`actor.json`](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/actor-definition/actor-json) file to control platform usage costs.

```json
{
    "actorSpecification": 1, 
    "name": "name-of-my-scraper",
    "version": "0.0",
    "minMemoryMbytes": 256,
    "maxMemoryMbytes": 4096,
}
```

### Charge for "Actor start"

Charge for "Actor start" to prevent users from running your Actor for free.

```typescript
import { Actor } from 'apify';

const chargeForActorStart = async () => {
  const chargingManager = Actor.getChargingManager();

  // Don't charge the "Actor start" event again after Actor migration
  if (chargingManager.getChargedEventCount("actor-start") === 0) {
    await Actor.charge({
      "eventName": "actor-start",
    });
  }
}

await Actor.init();

const main = async () => {
  await chargeForActorStart();

  // Continue with the Actor's main logic
};

await main();

await Actor.exit();
```

:::note Actor migrations and charging

Actors can migrate between servers during execution, which restarts the process and clears memory. When using PPE charging, avoid charging the start event multiple times after a migration by checking your charging state.
:::

### Charge for invalid input

Charge for invalid input or empty search to prevent users from running your Actor for free.

```typescript
import { Actor } from 'apify';
import { Input } from './types';

const parseInput = async (input: Input) => {
  if (!input.searchStringsArray && !input.startUrls && !input.allPlacesNoSearchAction) {
    await Actor.charge({
      eventName: "invalid-input",
    });
    
    throw await Actor.fail('INVALID INPUT: You must provide either search terms, start URLs, or allPlacesNoSearchAction!');
  }

  return input;
};

await Actor.init();

const main = async () => {
  const input = await Actor.getInput();
  const parsedInput = await parseInput(input);
  
  // Continue with the Actor's main logic
};

await main();

await Actor.exit();
```

### Respect user spending limits

Finish the Actor run once charging reaches user-configured Maximum cost per run. Apify SDKs (JS and Python) return ChargeResult that helps determine when to finish.

```typescript
import { Actor } from 'apify';

const MAX_COST = Number(process.env.ACTOR_MAX_TOTAL_CHARGE_USD);

const chargForApiCall = async () => {
  const chargeResult = await Actor.charge({
    eventName: "api-call",
  });

  return chargeResult;
};

await Actor.init();

const main = async () => {
  // actual API call

  const chargeResult = await chargForApiCall();

  if (chargeResult.totalCost >= MAX_COST) {
    await Actor.exit();
  }

  // continue with the Actor's main logic
};

await main();

await Actor.exit();
```

### Use idempotency keys to prevent double charges

If you're not using the Apify SDKs (JS/Python), you need to handle idempotency (ensuring the same operation produces the same result when called multiple times) manually to prevent charging the same event multiple times.

### Keep pricing simple with fewer events

Try to limit the number of events. Fewer events make it easier for users to understand your pricing and predict their costs.

### Make events produce tangible results

Try to make your event have tangible artifacts that users can see and understand (this might not be possible when using external APIs). Each charged event should produce something concrete in the user's dataset.

Good examples:

- **"scraped-product"** event: Each charge adds one product record to the dataset
- **"processed-image"** event: Each charge adds one processed image to the dataset  
- **"extracted-review"** event: Each charge adds one review to the dataset

Avoid charging for:

- Internal processing steps that don't produce visible results
- API calls that don't generate user-visible data
- Setup or configuration steps

This helps users understand exactly what they're paying for and builds trust in your pricing model.

## PPE event names

To implement pay-per-event pricing, you need to define specific events in your Actor code. You can retrieve the list of available pricing event names using the [Get Actor](https://apify.com/docs/api/v2/act-get) API endpoint.

## How to attract larger customers of PPE and PPR Actors

Each user running your PPE or PPR Actor belongs to a discount tier:

- _FREE_
- _BRONZE_
- _SILVER_
- _GOLD_


You can define different prices for different tiers.
While optional, we recommend offering progressively lower prices for higher discount tiers. This approach can significantly improve attractiveness of your Actor to large enterprise customers who may spend thousands or tens of thousands of dollars on it.

Your platform costs are also lower for these higher tier, which helps maintain healthy profit margins. This is further detailed in the [Computing your costs for PPE and PPR Actors](#computing-your-costs-for-ppe-and-ppr-actors) section.

By default, we advise against setting excessively high prices for _FREE_ tier users, as this can limit the ability to evaluate your Actor thoroughly. However, in certain situations, such as protecting your Actor from fraudulent activity or excessive use of your internal APIs, a higher price for _FREE_ tier users might be justified.

During an Actor run, you can identify the user's discount tier through Actor run environment variables or by querying user data via the Apify API. This capability allows you to offer premium features or differentiated service levels to users in higher discount tiers.

In addition to the standard tiers, Apify provides further tiers specifically for enterprise customers, including _PLATINUM_ and _DIAMOND_ tiers. If you are interested in offering enterprise-level services and attracting major clients, please contact us.

## Computing your costs for PPE and PPR Actors

For both PPE and PPR Actors, profit is computed using the formula `(0.8 * revenue) - costs`. In this section, we'll explain how the `costs` component is calculated.

When paying users run your Actor, it generates platform usage in the form of compute units, data traffic, API operations etc. This usage determines the `costs` in the profit formula above.

:::note _FREE_ tier usage

Platform usage by _FREE_ tier users is covered by Apify and does not contribute to your costs.

:::

To calculate your costs in dollars for a specific run by paying user, multiply the unit cost of each service by the quantity consumed. For example, if a _BRONZE_ tier user run uses 10 compute units (CUs) at $0.4/CU, your cost would be $4.

As highlighted in the [How to attract larger customers of PPE and PPR Actors](#how-to-attract-larger-customers-of-ppe-and-ppr-actors) section, if your Actor uses tiered pricing, the user's discount tier determines the unit costs applied to their runs. Your costs are lower for higher tiers, enabling you to offer more competitive pricing to these customers, while sustaining healthy profit margins.

The following table summarizes the platform unit costs used for your cost computation  across different discount tiers.

| Service                         | Price is per | _FREE_  | _BRONZE_ | _SILVER_ | _GOLD_  |
|:-------------------------------|:--------------|--------:|---------:|---------:|--------:|
| Compute unit                   | CU            | $0.4    | $0.4     | $0.3     | $0.25   |
| Residential proxies            | GB            | $8      | $8       | $7.5     | $7      |

If you decide not to offer tiered discounts on your Actor, the unit prices for _FREE_ tier apply. To offer enterprise level services and unlock even cheaper unit prices for enterprise customers, please reach out to us.

:::note Cost of PPE Actors in Standby mode

When you monetize your Actor in Standby mode using pay per event mode only, you are not responsible for covering platform usage costs of your users' runs.

## Changing monetization

You can change the monetization setting of your Actor by using the same wizard as for the setup in the **Monetization** section of your Actor's **Publication** tab. Any changes made to an already published Actor will take _14 days_ to come into effect, so that the users of your Actor have time to prepare.

:::important Frequency of monetization adjustments

Be aware that you can change the monetization setting of each Actor only once per month. For further information and guidelines, please refer to our [Terms & Conditions](https://apify.com/store-terms-and-conditions)

:::

## Monthly payouts and analytics

Payout invoices are automatically generated on the 11th of each month, summarizing the profits from all your Actors for the previous month.
In accordance with our [Terms & Conditions](https://apify.com/store-terms-and-conditions), only funds from legitimate users who have already paid are included in the payout invoice.

:::note How negative profits are handled

If your PPR or PPE Actor's price doesn't cover its monthly platform usage costs, it will have a negative profit. When this occurs, we automatically set that Actor's profit to $0 for the month. This ensures a single Actor's loss never reduces your total payout.

:::

You have 3 days to review your payout invoice in the **Development >Insights > Payout** section. During this period, you can either approve the invoice or request a revision, which we will process promptly.
If no action is taken, the payout will be automatically approved on the 14th, with funds disbursed shortly after. Payouts require meeting minimum thresholds of either:

- $20 for PayPal
- $100 for other payout methods

If the monthly profit does not meet these thresholds, as per our [Terms & Conditions](https://apify.com/store-terms-and-conditions), the funds will roll over to the next month until the threshold is reached.

## Actor analytics

Monitor your Actors' performance through the [Actor Analytics](https://console.apify.com/actors/insights/analytics) dashboard under **Development > Insights > Analytics**.

The analytics dashboard allows you to select specific Actors and view key metrics aggregated across all user runs:

- Revenue, costs and profit trends over time
- User growth metrics (both paid and free users)
- Cost per 1,000 results to optimize pricing
- Run success rate statistics
- User acquisition funnel analytics
- Shared debug runs from users

All metrics can be exported as JSON for custom analysis and reporting.

## Promoting your Actor

Create serach-engine-optimized descriptions and README files to improve search engine visibility. Share your Actor on multiple channels:

- Post on Reddit, Quora, and social media platforms
- Create tutorial videos demonstrating key features
- Publish articles about your Actor on relevant websites
- Consider creating a product showcase on platforms like Product Hunt

Remember to tag Apify in your social media posts for additional exposure. Effective promotion can significantly impact your Actor's success, differentiating between those with many paid users and those with few to none.
