## Actors overview

Actors are serverless programs to automate workflows and extract data. Each Actor takes a structured JSON input, performs a task (like web scraping, browser automation, or data processing), and can optionally produce a structured output. Actors are easy to run manually, via API, or on a schedule, and you can combine them into larger automations.

## Actor components

Actors consist of these elements:

- _Dockerfile_ which specifies where the Actor's source code is, how to build it, and run it.
- _Documentation_ in a form of a README.md file.
- _Input and output schemas_ that describe what input the Actor requires, and what results it produces.
- Access to an out-of-the-box _storage system_ for Actor data, results, and files.
- _Metadata_ such as the Actor name, description, author, and version.

The documentation and input/output schemas help people understand what the Actor does, enter required inputs in the user interface or API, and integrate results into other workflows. Actors can call and interact with each other to build more complex systems from simple ones.

## Build Actors

Build Actors to automate tasks, scrape data, or create custom workflows. The Apify platform gives you everything you need to develop, test, and deploy your code.

Ready to start? Check out the [Actor development documentation](/platform/actors/development).

## Running Actors

You can run Actors manually in [Apify Console](https://console.apify.com/actors), using the [API](/api), [CLI](/cli), or [scheduler](./running/schedules.md). You can easily [integrate Actors](../integrations/index.mdx) with other apps, [share](../account/access_rights.md) them with other people, [publish](./publishing/index.mdx) them in [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store), and even [monetize](./publishing/monetize/index.mdx).

## Public and private Actors

Actors can be [public](./actors/running/actors-in-store) or private. Private Actors are yours to use and keep; no one will see them if you don't want them to. Public Actors are [available to everyone](./running/store.md) in [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store). You can make them free to use, or you can [charge for them](https://blog.apify.com/make-regular-passive-income-developing-web-automation-actors-b0392278d085/).
