# Tutorials

**Learn how to scrape the web and automate processes with Apify. From beginner guides for using actors to advanced topics like migrations and performance.**

---

This section contains everything you need to get you up and running with Apify, as well as advanced techniques for experienced users. Before you start, it will help to have an [Apify account](https://console.apify.com) set up and ready to go.

## The basics

[Quick start](./quick_start.md) will show you how to [run existing actors](./quick_start.md) and [create your first Apify actor](./quick_start.md#create-an-actor).

[Set up your first web scraping job](/academy/apify-scrapers/getting-started) with a step-by-step guide.

## Next steps

If you liked what you learned, get familiar with our main tools by following
the [tutorial](/academy/apify-scrapers/web-scraper) for **Web Scraper** ([apify/web-scraper](https://apify.com/apify/web-scraper)),
the [tutorial](/academy/apify-scrapers/cheerio-scraper) for **Cheerio Scraper** ([apify/cheerio-scraper](https://apify.com/apify/cheerio-scraper)),
or the [tutorial](/academy/apify-scrapers/puppeteer-scraper) for **Puppeteer Scraper** ([apify/puppeteer-scraper](https://apify.com/apify/puppeteer-scraper))

Or, if the solution you need is beyond your skillset or schedule, you can always [order a custom solution](https://apify.com/custom-solutions).

## Building actors

Building your own actors requires some experience with coding. If you're ready, get started with the [Apify SDK](/sdk/js/) and [Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev/docs/quick-start).

"But wait, I don't speak JavaScript", we hear you say. Worry not! While we currently only have an SDK for JavaScript, your actor can be in any programming language. If you use Python, you can now [scrape data with Beautiful Soup](/academy/python/scrape-data-python)
and [parse the results with Pandas](/academy/python/process-data-using-python) on the Apify platform. Prefer PHP? Cool! Here's how you can [use Apify in your PHP projects](/academy/php/using-apify-scraper-with-php).

## Advanced use cases

Check out our other tutorials that cover more specific and advanced scenarios such as [scraping dynamic content](/academy/puppeteer-playwright/page/waiting), [integrating](../integrations/index.md) your projects with Apify, [using your actors via API](./run_actor_and_retrieve_data_via_api.md), or setting up [monitoring](../monitoring/index.md) for your projects.
