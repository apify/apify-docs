# Building public actors

**Learn about the flow for building, publishing, and maintaining public actors that on the Apify platform. Also learn about how to monetize your actors.**

---

There are four main stages of building a public actor:

1. [Development](../actors/development/index.md).
2. [Publication](../actors/publishing.md).
3. [Testing and maintenance](../actors/development/testing_and_maintenance.md).
4. [Promotion](/academy/get-most-of-actors/seo-and-promotion).

While you don't have to maintain private actors, public actors are a more long-term project. Be prepared to stick with the project for at least a few months. Ensure you have enough time to maintain the project (~2 hours weekly). With this perspective, you will be able to monetize and promote your actors better.

If your code is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com), its quality is a priority since your actors may be a new user's first and critical contact with Apify. Code should be open to changes and updates â€“ don't fear to refactor. Beware of breaking changes, though! If you do a breaking change, communicate it to all existing users with an explanation.

Documentation is vital (your actor's README). It should be clear, detailed, and readable. Think of the users, who might not be developers, so use simple, easy-to-understand language and avoid technical jargon.

Ensure periodic testing. You can either do it yourself or [set up automatic tests](../actors/development/testing_and_maintenance.md) / [monitoring](https://apify.com/apify/monitoring). Try to prevent your users from coming to you with the issues.
