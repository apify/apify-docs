**Learn how to collaborate with other users and manage permissions for organizations or private resources such as Actors, Actor runs, and storages.**

---

By default, each system resource (Actor, key-value store, run, ...) you create is only available to you, the owner. There are three ways you can grant access to your resources:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><strong><a href="/platform/collaboration/access-rights">Access rights</a></strong></td>
        <td>Enables you to grant access to another user for a certain resource you own. This way, you can share results with your client, or two engineers can collaborate on developing one Actor.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong><a href="/platform/collaboration/organization-account">Organization account</a></strong></td>
        <td>Apify's organization account allows multiple engineers to collaborate on team projects with role-specific access permissions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong><a href="/platform/actors/publishing">Publishing in Apify Store</a></strong></td>
        <td>Another way to share your Actor with other users is to publish it in <a href="https://apify.com/store">Apify Store</a>. When publishing your Actor, you can make it a Paid Actor and get paid by the users benefiting from your tool. For more information, read the <a href="/platform/actors/publishing">publishing and monetization</a> section.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
