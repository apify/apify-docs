The _Apify Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server_ allows AI applications to connect to Apify‚Äôs extensive library of Actors as tools to perform web scraping, data extraction, or other automation tasks in real time.

## Quickstart

You can use the Apify MCP Server in two ways:

- _Standard Input/Output (stdio)_: Ideal for local integrations and command-line tools such as the Claude desktop client.
  - Set MCP client server command to `npx @apify/actors-mcp-server` and environment variable `APIFY_TOKEN` to your Apify API token
  - See `npx @apify/actors-mcp-server --help` for more options
- _HTTPS Endpoint_ [mcp.apify.com](https://mcp.apify.com): Connect your MCP client by including `Authorization: Bearer <APIFY_TOKEN>` header in your requests.
  - `https://mcp.apify.com` for streamable transport
  - `https://mcp.apify.com/sse` for legacy SSE transport

You could also use legacy option by running [Apify Actors MCP Server](https://apify.com/apify/actors-mcp-server) as an Actor.


## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

1. _An Apify account:_ Sign up for a free Apify account if you don‚Äôt have one.
1. _Apify API Token:_ Get your personal API token from the¬†**Integrations**¬†section in¬†[Apify Console](https://console.apify.com/account#/integrations). This token will be used to authorize the MCP server to run Actors on your behalf.
1. _MCP client:_ An AI agent or client that supports MCP. This could be Anthropic Claude desktop, a VS Code extension with MCP support, Apify‚Äôs web-based Tester MCP Client, or any custom client implementation. See supported MCP clients in [official documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients).

## Example usage (local stdio with Claude desktop)

Let‚Äôs walk through an example of using Claude desktop with the Apify MCP Server:

1. _Configure Claude desktop:_ Claude desktop supports MCP servers via the **Developer settings**. You need to add an entry for the Apify MCP server. For instance, in Claude‚Äôs config file, under `mcpServers`, add an entry like:

    ```json
    {
     "mcpServers": {
       "actors-mcp-server": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@apify/actors-mcp-server"],
         "env": {
            "APIFY_TOKEN": "YOUR_APIFY_TOKEN"
         }
       }
     }
    }
    ```

    This tells Claude to spawn the Apify MCP Server (via the [Actors MCP Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apify/actors-mcp-server) NPM package with your API token (on the first run, it will download the package automatically).

1. _Launch Claude and connect:_ After updating the config, restart Claude desktop. If successful, Claude will show a ‚Äúplugin‚Äù (often indicated by a plug icon üîå) signifying it connected to the Apify Actors MCP server.

1. _Use the Actors in conversation:_ You can chat with Claude and ask it to use Apify Actors. For example: _‚ÄúWhat Apify Actors can I use?‚Äù_ Claude will list available tools via the MCP server. If none are pre-loaded, it may show defaults or guide you to find more.

_(If you prefer not to set up Claude desktop, you can achieve a similar result using [Apify‚Äôs Tester MCP Client](https://apify.com/jiri.spilka/tester-mcp-client), which provides a web UI to test the MCP server.)_

## Interact with the MCP server over SSE

You can interact with the server through Server-Sent Events (SSE) to send messages and receive responses.

In the client settings, you need to provide server configuration:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "apify": {
            "type": "sse",
            "url": "https://mcp.apify.com/sse",
            "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer your-apify-token"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Adding Multiple Actors

By default, the main Actors MCP Server starts with a single default [RAG Web Browser Actor](https://apify.com/apify/rag-web-browser). However, you can fully customize which Actors are available:

- _Dynamic adding during a session:_ If your client supports it, the agent itself can add Actors dynamically by name (using the `add-actor` operation) at runtime. For example, after using `search-actors` to find an Actor‚Äôs name, calling `add-actor` with that name will load it. Note that not all MCP client frameworks allow dynamic tool addition at runtime, but Apify‚Äôs own tester client does, if `enableAddingActors` is enabled‚Äîeither via `?enableAddingActors=true` in the MCP Server URL, or with the CLI flag `--enable-adding-actors` (can also be set in Claude Desktop config args as `--enable-adding-actors`).
- _Via config file (for Claude desktop):_ When using Claude desktop, you can specify which Actors should be immediately available by configuring your `mcpServers` settings. Add the Actors as a comma-separated list in the `--actors` parameter, as shown in the example below. This pre-loads your selected tools without requiring discovery during conversations, ideal for workflows with predictable tool needs.

```json
   {
    "mcpServers": {
      "actors-mcp-server": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
          "-y", "@apify/actors-mcp-server",
          "--actors", "lukaskrivka/google-maps-with-contact-details,apify/instagram-scraper"
        ],
        "env": {
           "APIFY_TOKEN": "YOUR_APIFY_TOKEN"
        }
      }
    }
   }
```

In summary, you can start with a broad set (everything open and discoverable) or a narrow set (just what you need) and even expand tools on the fly, giving your agent a lot of flexibility without overwhelming it initially.

## Dynamic Actor tooling

One of the powerful features of MCP with Apify is **dynamic actor tooling** ‚Äì the ability for an AI agent to find new tools (Actors) as needed and incorporate them. Here are some special MCP operations and how Apify MCP Server supports them:

- _Actor discovery and management:_ Search for [Actors](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors) (`search-actors`), view details (`get-actor-details`), and dynamically add or remove tools (`add-actor`, `remove-actor`).
- _Actor execution and monitoring:_ Start [Actor runs](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/runs-and-builds#runs), fetch run results (`get-actor-run`), logs (`get-actor-log`), and abort runs (`abort-actor-run`).
- _Dataset access:_ List [datasets](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/dataset), retrieve dataset info and items (`get-dataset`, `get-dataset-list`, `get-dataset-items`).
- _Key-value store access:_ List [key-value stores](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/key-value-store), view keys, and retrieve records (`get-key-value-store-list`, `get-key-value-store`, `get-key-value-store-keys`, `get-key-value-store-record`).
- _Built-in help tool:_ A static helper (`apify-actor-help-tool`) that returns usage info for the Apify MCP Server.

## Troubleshooting

- _Authorization (API Token):_ If the MCP server isn‚Äôt executing Actors, ensure you provided a correct Apify API token. Without a valid `APIFY_TOKEN`, the server cannot start Actor runs. Always set the `APIFY_TOKEN` environment variable when running locally.
- _Ensure latest version:_ If running via NPM, always use the latest version of `@apify/actors-mcp-server` for the newest features and fixes. You can append `@latest` when installing or in your config args to ensure this.
- _Node.js environment:_ If running the server locally, make sure Node.js is installed and up to date (`node -v`). The MCP server requires Node.js v18+.
- _No response or long delay:_ Keep in mind that when an Actor tool is called, it may take some time to complete (depending on the task). If nothing is coming back, check the Actor‚Äôs logs in Apify console ‚Äî the Actor might be waiting on a long operation or input.
