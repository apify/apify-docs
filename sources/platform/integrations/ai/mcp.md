## Quickstart

You can use the Apify MCP Server in two ways:

- _HTTPS Endpoint_ `mcp.apify.com`: Connect your MCP client through OAuth or by including `Authorization: Bearer <APIFY_TOKEN>` header in your requests.
  - `https://mcp.apify.com` for streamable transport (recommended)
  - `https://mcp.apify.com/sse` for SSE transport (legacy)
- _Standard Input/Output (stdio)_: Ideal for local integrations and command-line tools such as the Claude for Desktop client.
  - Set MCP client server command to `npx @apify/actors-mcp-server` and environment variable `APIFY_TOKEN` to your Apify API token
  - See `npx @apify/actors-mcp-server --help` for more options

You could also use legacy option by running [Apify Actors MCP Server](https://apify.com/apify/actors-mcp-server) as an Actor.

:::tip Run instantly ‚ö°

To install the Apify MCP Server in [Claude for Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) with one click, download and run the latest [Apify MCP Server DXT file](https://github.com/apify/actors-mcp-server/releases/latest/download/actors-mcp-server.dxt)

:::


## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

1. _An Apify account:_ Sign up for a free Apify account if you don‚Äôt have one.
1. _Apify API Token:_ Get your personal API token from the¬†**Integrations**¬†section in¬†[Apify Console](https://console.apify.com/account#/integrations). This token will be used to authorize the MCP server to run Actors on your behalf.
1. _MCP client:_ An AI agent or client that supports MCP. This could be Anthropic Claude for Desktop, a VS Code extension with MCP support, Apify‚Äôs web-based Tester MCP Client, or any custom client implementation. See supported MCP clients in [official documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients).

## Example usage (Streamable HTTP with OAuth)

We recommend connecting through OAuth for a secure and simple authentication process.

During setup, provide the server URL `https://mcp.apify.com`. You will then be redirected to your browser to sign in to your Apify account and approve the connection. The configuration steps may vary slightly depending on your MCP client.

```json
{
 "mcpServers": {
   "apify": {
     "url": "https://mcp.apify.com"
   }
 }
}
```

## Example usage (local stdio with Claude for Desktop)

Let‚Äôs walk through an example of using Claude for Desktop with the Apify MCP Server:

1. _Configure Claude for Desktop:_ Enable MCP servers via the **Developer settings**. You need to add an entry for the Apify MCP server. For instance, in Claude‚Äôs config file, under `mcpServers`, add an entry like:

    ```json
    {
     "mcpServers": {
       "actors-mcp-server": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@apify/actors-mcp-server"],
         "env": {
            "APIFY_TOKEN": "YOUR_APIFY_TOKEN"
         }
       }
     }
    }
    ```

    This tells Claude to spawn the Apify MCP Server (via the [Actors MCP Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apify/actors-mcp-server) NPM package with your API token (on the first run, it will download the package automatically).

1. _Launch Claude and connect:_ After updating the config, restart Claude for Desktop. If successful, Claude will show a ‚Äúplugin‚Äù (often indicated by a plug icon üîå) signifying it connected to the Apify Actors MCP server.

1. _Use the Actors in conversation:_ You can chat with Claude and ask it to use Apify Actors. For example: _‚ÄúWhat Apify Actors can I use?‚Äù_ Claude will list available tools via the MCP server. If none are pre-loaded, it may show defaults or guide you to find more.

:::note Web-based alternative

If you prefer not to set up Claude desktop, you can achieve a similar result using [Apify‚Äôs Tester MCP Client](https://apify.com/jiri.spilka/tester-mcp-client), which provides a web UI to test the MCP server.)

## Interact with the MCP server over SSE

You can interact with the server through Server-Sent Events (SSE) to send messages and receive responses.

In the client settings, you need to provide server configuration:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "apify": {
            "type": "sse",
            "url": "https://mcp.apify.com/sse",
            "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer your-apify-token"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Adding Multiple Actors

By default, the main Actors MCP Server starts with a single default [RAG Web Browser Actor](https://apify.com/apify/rag-web-browser). However, you can fully customize which Actors are available:

- _Dynamic adding during a session:_ If your client supports it, the agent itself can add Actors dynamically by name (using the `add-actor` operation) at runtime. For example, after using `search-actors` to find an Actor‚Äôs name, calling `add-actor` with that name will load it.
  _Tools for adding and removing Actors are enabled by default._
  You can disable these tools by setting the parameter `?enableAddingActors=false` in the MCP Server URL, or with the CLI flag `--enable-adding-actors=false` (can also be set in Claude for Desktop config args as `--enable-adding-actors=false`).
  Not all MCP client frameworks allow dynamic tool addition at runtime, but Apify‚Äôs own tester client does, if adding Actors is enabled.
- _Via url:_ If you are using Streamable HTTP or SSE protocol, you could add `actors` query parameter with Actor names separated by comma:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Apify": {
      "url": "https://mcp.apify.com/?actors=lukaskrivka/google-maps-with-contact-details,apify/instagram-scraper"
    }
  }
}
```

- _Via config file:_ For local stdio connection, you can specify which Actors should be immediately available by configuring your json configuration. Add the Actors as a comma-separated list in the `--actors` parameter, as shown in the example below. This pre-loads your selected tools without requiring discovery during conversations, ideal for workflows with predictable tool needs.

```json
   {
    "mcpServers": {
      "actors-mcp-server": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
          "-y", "@apify/actors-mcp-server",
          "--actors", "lukaskrivka/google-maps-with-contact-details,apify/instagram-scraper"
        ],
        "env": {
           "APIFY_TOKEN": "YOUR_APIFY_TOKEN"
        }
      }
    }
   }
```


In summary, you can start with a broad set (everything open and discoverable) or a narrow set (just what you need) and even expand tools on the fly, giving your agent a lot of flexibility without overwhelming it initially.

## Configure tools for the MCP server

You can customize the MCP server‚Äôs available tools by adding query parameters to the server URL or by passing arguments to the CLI.
This allows you to enable or disable specific tool categories and control which tools are available.

The following tool categories are available:

- _Actor discovery and management_ (default, always enabled): Search for [Actors](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors) (`search-actors`), view details (`get-actor-details`), and dynamically add them (`add-actor`).
- _docs_ (default, can be disabled): Search Apify documentation (`search-apify-docs`) and fetch specific documents (`fetch-apify-docs`).
- _runs_ (optional): Get a list of your [Actor runs](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/runs-and-builds#runs) (`get-actor-run-list`), specific run details (`get-actor-run`), and logs from a specific Actor run (`get-actor-log`).
- _storage_ (optional): Access [datasets](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/dataset) and [key-value stores](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/key-value-store), including their records (`get-dataset`, `get-dataset-items`, `get-dataset-list`, `get-key-value-store`, `get-key-value-store-keys`, `get-key-value-store-record`, `get-key-value-store-records`).
- _preview_ (optional): Experimental tools in preview mode. Call any Actor using API (`call-actor`).

The _Actor discovery and management_ tools are always present and cannot be disabled.
The _docs_ tools are enabled by default but can be switched off using the `tools` parameter.

### Configure mcp.apify.com using query parameters

Use the `tools` query parameter to enable or disable specific tool categories.

For example, to enable only the `runs` and `storage` tools, you can use:

```text
https://mcp.apify.com/?tools=runs,storage
```

The server will expose all _Actor discovery and management tools_, as well as `runs` and `storage`.
The list of tools you can enable/disable is as follows: `docs`, `runs`, `storage`, and `preview`.



### Configure STDIO server using CLI arguments

When running the MCP server via the command line, you can specify the tools using the `--tools` parameter.
For example, to enable only the `runs` and `storage` tools, you can run:

```bash
npx @apify/actors-mcp-server --tools runs,storage
```

## Dynamic discovery of Actors

One of the powerful features of MCP with Apify is **dynamic Actor tooling** ‚Äì the ability for an AI agent to find new tools (Actors) as needed and incorporate them.

Supported dynamic tool operations (enabled by default):

- `search-actors`: Find available Actors by keyword or category.
- `get-actor-details`: View details and usage information for a specific Actor.
- `add-actor`: Dynamically add an Actor as a tool for the current session, making it available for use.

These operations allow your agent to expand its toolset on demand, without requiring a server restart or manual configuration.

Dynamic tool addition can be disabled using the `?enableAddingActors=false`.
Not all MCP clients support dynamic tool addition.
Check your client‚Äôs documentation or settings to confirm this feature is available.

## Rate limits

The Apify MCP server has a rate limit of _30 requests per second_ per user. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Troubleshooting

- _Authorization (API Token):_ If the MCP server isn‚Äôt executing Actors, ensure you provided a correct Apify API token. Without a valid `APIFY_TOKEN`, the server cannot start Actor runs. Always set the `APIFY_TOKEN` environment variable when running locally.
- _Ensure latest version:_ If running via NPM, always use the latest version of `@apify/actors-mcp-server` for the newest features and fixes. You can append `@latest` when installing or in your config args to ensure this.
- _Node.js environment:_ If running the server locally, make sure Node.js is installed and up to date (`node -v`). The MCP server requires Node.js v18+.
- _No response or long delay:_ Keep in mind that when an Actor tool is called, it may take some time to complete (depending on the task). If nothing is coming back, check the Actor‚Äôs logs in Apify console ‚Äî the Actor might be waiting on a long operation or input.
