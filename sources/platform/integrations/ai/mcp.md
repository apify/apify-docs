The _Apify Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server_ allows AI applications to connect to Apify‚Äôs extensive library of Actors as tools to perform web scraping, data extraction, or other automation tasks in real time.

## Quickstart

You can use the Apify MCP Server in two ways:

- Standard Input/Output (stdio): Ideal for local integrations and command-line tools such as the Claude desktop client.
    - Set MCP client server command to `npx @apify/actors-mcp-server` and environment variable `APIFY_TOKEN` to your Apify API token
    - See `npx @apify/actors-mcp-server --help` for more options
- HTTPS Endpoint [mcp.apify.com](https://mcp.apify.com): Connect your MCP client by including `Authorization: Bearer <APIFY_TOKEN>` header in your requests.
    - `https://mcp.apify.com` for streamable transport
    - `https://mcp.apify.com/sse` for legacy SSE transport

_(You could also use legacy option by running [Apify Actors MCP Server](https://apify.com/apify/actors-mcp-server) as Actor.)_


## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

1. _An Apify account:_ Sign up for a free Apify account if you don‚Äôt have one.
1. _Apify API Token:_ Get your personal API token from the¬†**Integrations**¬†section in¬†[Apify Console](https://console.apify.com/account#/integrations). This token will be used to authorize the MCP server to run Actors on your behalf.
1. _MCP client:_ You will also need an AI agent or client that supports MCP. This could be Anthropic Claude desktop, a VS Code extension with MCP support, Apify‚Äôs web-based Tester MCP Client, or any custom client implementation. See supported MCP clients in [official documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients).

## Example usage (local stdio with Claude desktop)

Let‚Äôs walk through an example of using Claude desktop with the Apify MCP Server:

1. _Configure Claude desktop:_ Claude desktop supports MCP servers via the **Developer settings**. You need to add an entry for the Apify MCP server. For instance, in Claude‚Äôs config file, under `mcpServers`, add an entry like:

    ```json
    {
     "mcpServers": {
       "actors-mcp-server": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@apify/actors-mcp-server"],
         "env": {
            "APIFY_TOKEN": "YOUR_APIFY_TOKEN"
         }
       }
     }
    }
    ```

    This tells Claude to spawn the Apify MCP Server (via the [Actors MCP Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apify/actors-mcp-server) NPM package with your API token (on the first run, it will download the package automatically).

1. _Launch Claude and connect:_ After updating the config, restart Claude desktop. If successful, Claude will show a ‚Äúplugin‚Äù (often indicated by a plug icon üîå) signifying it connected to the Apify Actors MCP server.

1. _Use the Actors in conversation:_ You can chat with Claude and ask it to use Apify Actors. For example: _‚ÄúWhat Apify Actors can I use?‚Äù_ Claude will list available tools via the MCP server. If none are pre-loaded, it may show defaults or guide you to find more. Then you can say: _‚ÄúUse the Instagram Scraper to get NASA‚Äôs latest posts,‚Äù_ and Claude will run the apify/instagram-scraper Actor and return the results.

_(If you prefer not to set up Claude desktop, you can achieve a similar result using [Apify‚Äôs Tester MCP Client](https://apify.com/jiri.spilka/tester-mcp-client), which provides a web UI to test the MCP server.)_

## Interact with the MCP Server over SSE

You can interact with the server through Server-Sent Events (SSE) to send messages and receive responses.

In the client settings, you need to provide server configuration:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "apify": {
            "type": "sse",
            "url": "https://actors-mcp-server.apify.actor/sse",
            "env": {
                "APIFY_TOKEN": "your-apify-token"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Adding Multiple Actors

By default, the main Actors MCP Server starts with a single default Actor: [RAG Web Browser](https://apify.com/apify/rag-web-browser). However, you can fully customize which Actors are available:

- **Dynamic adding during a session:** If your client supports it, the agent itself can add Actors dynamically by name (using the `add-actor` operation) at runtime. For example, after using `search-actors` to find an Actor‚Äôs name, calling `add-actor` with that name will load it. Note that not all MCP client frameworks allow dynamic tool addition at runtime, but Apify‚Äôs own tester client does, if `enableAddingActors` is enabled‚Äîeither via `?enableAddingActors=true` in the MCP Server URL, or with the CLI flag `--enable-adding-actors` (can also be set in Claude Desktop config args as `--enable-adding-actors`).
- **Via config file (for Claude desktop):** When using Claude desktop, you can specify which Actors should be immediately available by configuring your `mcpServers` settings. Add the Actors as a comma-separated list in the `--actors` parameter, as shown in the example below. This pre-loads your selected tools without requiring discovery during conversations, ideal for workflows with predictable tool needs.

```json
   {
    "mcpServers": {
      "actors-mcp-server": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
          "-y", "@apify/actors-mcp-server",
          "--actors", "lukaskrivka/google-maps-with-contact-details,apify/instagram-scraper"
        ],
        "env": {
           "APIFY_TOKEN": "YOUR_APIFY_TOKEN"
        }
      }
    }
   }
```

In summary, you can start with a broad set (everything open and discoverable) or a narrow set (just what you need) and even expand tools on the fly, giving your agent a lot of flexibility without overwhelming it initially.

## Dynamic Actor Tooling

One of the powerful features of MCP with Apify is **dynamic actor tooling** ‚Äì the ability for an AI agent to find new tools (Actors) as needed and incorporate them. Here are some special MCP operations and how Apify MCP Server supports them:

- **`search-actors`:** Discover available Actors or MCP-Servers in Apify Store using full text search using keywords.Users try to discover Actors using free form query in this case search query must be converted to full text search. Returns a list of Actors with name, description, run statistics, pricing, starts, and URL. You perhaps need to use this tool several times to find the right Actor. You should prefer simple keywords over complex queries. Limit number of results returned but ensure that relevant results are returned. This is not a general search tool, it is designed to search for Actors in Apify Store.
- **`get-actor-details`:** Get documentation, readme, input schema and other details about an Actor. For example, when user says, I need to know more about web crawler Actor.Get details for an Actor with with Actor ID or Actor full name, i.e. username/name.Limit the length of the README if needed.
- **`help-tool`:** Helper tool to get information on how to use and troubleshoot the Apify MCP server. This tool always returns the same help message with information about the server and how to use it. Call this tool in case of any problems or uncertainties with the server.
- **`add-actor`:** Add a tool, Actor or MCP-Server to available tools by Actor ID or Actor name. A tool is an Actor or MCP-Server that can be called by the userDo not execute the tool, only add it and list it in available tools. For example, add a tool with username/name when user wants to scrape data from a website.
- **`remove-actor`:** Remove a tool, an Actor or MCP-Server by name from available tools. For example, when user says, I do not need a tool username/name anymore

## Troubleshooting

- _Authorization (API Token):_ If the MCP server isn‚Äôt executing Actors, ensure you provided a correct Apify API token. Without a valid `APIFY_TOKEN`, the server cannot start Actor runs. Always set the `APIFY_TOKEN` environment variable when running locally.
- _Ensure latest version:_ If running via NPM, always use the latest version of `@apify/actors-mcp-server` for the newest features and fixes. You can append `@latest` when installing or in your config args to ensure this.
- _Node.js environment:_ If running the server locally, make sure Node.js is installed and up to date (`node -v`). The MCP server requires Node.js v18+.
- _No response or long delay:_ Keep in mind that when an Actor tool is called, it may take some time to complete (depending on the task). If nothing is coming back, check the Actor‚Äôs logs in Apify console ‚Äî the Actor might be waiting on a long operation or input.
