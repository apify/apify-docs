# What are Actor integrations?

 Actor integrations provide a way to connect your Actors with other Actors easily. They provide a new level of flexibility, as adding a new integration simply means creating [integration-ready Actors]('/platform/integrations/integration-ready-actors'). Thus, new integrations can be created by the community itself.

## How to integrate an Actor with other Actors?

To integrate one Actor with another:

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** tab in the Actor's detail page,
2. Select `Apify (Connect Actor or Task)`
3. Find the Actor you want to integrate with and click `Connect`.

This leads you to a setup screen, where you can provide:

- **Triggers**: events that will trigger the integrated Actor. These are the same as webhook [event types](/platform/integrations/webhooks/events) (*run succeeded*, *build failed*, etc.)
- **Input for the integrated Actor**: typically, the input has two parts. The information that is independent of the run triggering it, and information that is specific for that run. The "independent" information (e.g. connection string to database or table name) can be added to the input as is. The information specific to the run (e.g. dataset ID) is either obtained from implicit the `payload` field (this is the case for most Actors that are integration-ready), or they can be provided using variables.
- **Available variables** are the same ones as in webhooks. The one that you probably are going to need the most is `{{resource}}`, which is the Run object in the same shape you get from the [API](/api/v2#/reference/actor-runs/run-object-and-its-storages/get-run) (for build event types, it will be the Build object). The variables can make use of dot notation, so you will most likely just need `{{resource.defaultDatasetId}}` or `{{resource.defaultKeyValueStoreId}}`.

## Implementation details

Under the hood, the Actor integrations use regular [HTTP POST webhooks](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-a-webhook) targeting the Apify API, for which this feature provides a friendlier UI. The UI allows you to fill the payload template using the Actor input UI rather than plain text, and constructs the URL to start your actor with the given options.

The UI makes sure that the variables are enclosed in strings, meaning that event the payload template itself is a valid JSON, not just the resulting interpolation. It also automatically adds `payload` field that contains default webhook payload. So for Actors that are meant to be used as integrations, users donâ€™t have to fill in the variables, and Actor just takes the data from this field.
