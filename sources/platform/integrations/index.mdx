Integrations allow you to combine separate applications and take advantage of their combined capabilities. Automation of these online processes increases your productivity. That’s why we made Apify in a way that allows you to connect it with practically any cloud service or web app - and make it part of your larger projects.

## Built-in integrations

Apify‘s RESTful API allows you to interact with the platform programmatically, and HTTP webhooks notify you and your services when important events happen. By using API you can start Actors, retrieve their results, or basically do anything you can do in platform UI

<CardGrid>
    <Card
        title="API"
        desc="Control Apify platform programmatically from your code."
        to="/platform/integrations/api"
        smallImage
    />
    <Card
        title="Webhooks"
        desc="Trigger external events when your actor run fails or succeeds."
        to="/platform/integrations/webhooks"
        smallImage
    />
</CardGrid><br />

Apify offers easy-to-set-up solutions for common scenarios. Like uploading your datasets to Google Drive when the run succeeds or creating an issue on GitHub when it fails.

    <Card

        to="/platform/integrations/drive"
        imageUrl="/img/platform/integrations/drive.svg"
        smallImage

    <Card
        title="Gmail"
        to="/platform/integrations/gmail"

        smallImage

    <Card

        to="/"

## Automation platforms

If you are a user of one of the main automation platforms then we have Apify support ready for you. The main advantage of these platforms is that you can integrate Apify into very complex workflows with the choice of thousands of services supported.

<CardGrid>
    <Card
        title="Make"
        to="./integrations/make"
        imageUrl="/img/platform/integrations/make.svg"
        smallImage
    />
    <Card
        title="Zapier"
        to="./integrations/zapier"
        imageUrl="/img/platform/integrations/zapier.svg"
        smallImage
    />
    <Card
        title="Transposit"
        to="./integrations/transposit"
        imageUrl="/img/platform/integrations/transposit.svg"
        smallImage
    />
</CardGrid>

## Data pipelines, ETLs, and AI/LLM tools

Apify platform integrates with popular ETL and data pipeline services, enabling you to integrate Apify Actors directly into your data integration processes.

<CardGrid>
    <Card
        title="Keboola"
        to="./integrations/keboola"
        imageUrl="/img/platform/integrations/keboola.svg"
        smallImage
    />
    <Card
        title="Airbyte"
        to="./integrations/airbyte"
        imageUrl="/img/platform/integrations/airbyte.svg"
        smallImage
    />
    <Card
        title="Hevo"
        to="./integrations/hevo"
        imageUrl="/img/platform/integrations/hevo.svg"
        smallImage
    />
</CardGrid><br />

If you are working on an AI/LLM related project then we recommend you to look into the Langchain integration.

<CardGrid>
    <Card
        title="Langchain"
        to="./integrations/langchain"
        imageUrl="/img/platform/integrations/langchain.png"
        smallImage
    />
</CardGrid>

## Other Actors


At last, explore the [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store) for Actors that may help with the integration into your stack as, for example, [MongoDB Import](https://apify.com/drobnikj/mongodb-import) or [MySQL Insert](https://apify.com/petr_cermak/mysql-insert).
