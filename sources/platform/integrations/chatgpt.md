# Apify ChatGPT plugin

**Let ChatGPT access up-to-date information on the web. Fetch Google Search results, crawl smaller websites, query web pages found, and download individual web pages or files.**

---

The Apify ChatGPT plugin enables users to invoke various [Actors on Apify](https://apify.com/store),
in order to fetch up-to-date content from the web within [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/).

Currently, the plugin can use the following Actors:

- [Google Search Scraper](https://apify.com/apify/google-search-scraper): Fetch Google Search results
- [Website Content Crawler](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler): Download individual web pages or files
- [Website Content Vector Retriever](https://apify.com/hamza.alwan/website-content-vector-retriever): Crawl websites and query web pages found (experimental)

**IMPORTANT**: The plugin is currently under review by OpenAI, and hence it's not yet available in the ChatGPT Plugin store.
In order to test the plugin, you'll need to have the Developer mode enabled in ChatGPT, and install the plugin using
by going to **Install an unverified plugin** and entering "apify.com".
