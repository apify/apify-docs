**Learn how to integrate your Apify Actors with Airtable. This article shows you how to automatically upload results to your Airtable when an Actor run succeeds.**

[Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/)  is a cloud-based platform for organizing, managing, and collaborating on data. With Apify integration for Airtable, you can automatically upload Actor run results to Airtable after a successful run.

This integration uses OAuth 2.0, a secure authorization protocol, to connect your Airtable account to Apify and manage data transfers.

## Connect Apify with Airtable

To use the Apify integration for Airtable, ensure you have:

- An [Apify account](https://console.apify.com/)
- An [Airtable account](https://www.airtable.com/)

1. In Apify Console, go to the [API & Integrations tab](https://console.apify.com/settings/integrations) in the **Settings** section.
