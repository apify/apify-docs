# Proxy

**Learn to anonymously access websites in scraping/automation jobs. Improve data outputs and efficiency of bots, and access websites from various geographies.**

---

> [Apify Proxy](https://apify.com/proxy) allows you to change your IP address when web scraping to reduce the chance of being [blocked](/academy/anti-scraping/techniques) because of your geographical location.

You can use proxies in your [Actors](../actors/index.mdx) or any other application that supports HTTP proxies. Apify Proxy monitors the health of your IP pool and intelligently rotates addresses to prevent IP address-based blocking.

You can view your proxy settings and password on the [Proxy](https://console.apify.com/proxy) page in Apify Console. For pricing information, visit [apify.com/pricing](https://apify.com/pricing).


## Quickstart {#quickstart}

Usage of Apify Proxy means just a couple of lines of code, thanks to our [SDKs](/sdk):

<Tabs groupId="main">
<TabItem value="JavaScript SDK with PuppeteerCrawler" label="JavaScript SDK with PuppeteerCrawler">

```javascript
import { Actor } from 'apify';
import { PuppeteerCrawler } from 'crawlee';

await Actor.init();

const proxyConfiguration = await Actor.createProxyConfiguration();

const crawler = new PuppeteerCrawler({
    proxyConfiguration,
    async requestHandler({ page }) {
        console.log(await page.content());
    },
});

await crawler.run(['https://proxy.apify.com/?format=json']);

await Actor.exit();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python SDK with `requests`" label="Python SDK with requests">

```python
import requests, asyncio
from apify import Actor

async def main():
    async with Actor:
        proxy_configuration = await Actor.create_proxy_configuration()
        proxy_url = await proxy_configuration.new_url()

        proxies = {
            'http': proxy_url,
            'https': proxy_url,
        }

        response = requests.get('https://api.apify.com/v2/browser-info', proxies=proxies)
        print(response.text)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Proxy types {#proxy-types}

Several types of proxy servers exist, each offering distinct advantages, disadvantages, and varying pricing structures. You can use them to access websites from various geographies and with different levels of anonymity.
