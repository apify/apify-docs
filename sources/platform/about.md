**Learn about what Apify is and how it can help you. Get familiar with the platform and take you first steps in using actors.**

Apify is an online platform specializing in [web scraping](/academy/web-scraping-for-beginners), data processing and [robotic process automation](/academy/concepts/robotic-process-automation).

[Apify Store](https://apify.com/store) includes a range of ready-made tools such as **Booking Scraper** ([dtrungtin/booking-scraper](https://apify.com/dtrungtin/booking-scraper)), **SEO Audit Tool** ([drobnikj/seo-audit-tool](https://apify.com/drobnikj/seo-audit-tool)), or the **Google Sheets Import & Export** ([lukaskrivka/google-sheets](https://apify.com/lukaskrivka/google-sheets)) tool. You can try all of these for free right now.

If your needs are more specific, you can order a custom solution from [us](https://apify.com/enterprise).

## Get started {#get-started}

Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsidLZKdYWQ) on how to use our **Amazon Scraper** ([vaclavrut/amazon-crawler](https://apify.com/vaclavrut/amazon-crawler)). It introduces how web scraping can help your business and serves as a foundation on how to start using other ready-made actors.

### Tutorials {#tutorials}

When you're ready to go more in depth, visit our [tutorials](./tutorials/index.md) page, which guides you through using our ready-made scrapers.

## How does Apify work? {#how-does-apify-work}

Almost everything we do is centered around [actors](./actors/index.md). Actors are cloud programs that can scrape web pages, process data, automate workflows or anything else you can imagine.

You can learn more about actors from their [documentation](./actors/index.md).
