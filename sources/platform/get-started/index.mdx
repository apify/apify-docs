Apify is all about Actors - a new way to package your code to make it easy to share, integrate, and build upon. An Actor is a serverless program that takes a structured input, runs a task (web scraping, data processing, browser automation), and produces an output. You can choose from thousands of ready-made Actors in [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store), or create your own.
