# Apify Event Terms and Conditions

<!-- vale off -->

Effective date: November 3, 2025

These Event Terms and Conditions ("**Terms**") apply to all Events organized or co-organized by Apify Technologies s.r.o., a company registered in the Czech Republic, with its registered office at Vodičkova 704/36, 110 00 Prague 1, Czech Republic, Company ID No.: 04788290 ("**Apify**", "**we**", "**us**"), whether in-person, hybrid, or online ("**Events**").

**By registering for, or participating in, any Event, you agree to these Terms. If you disagree with these Terms, please do not register or attend any Event.**

## 1. Event Information.

1.1. Event details — including name, date, time, format, location (if applicable), registration process, and fees (if applicable) — will be specified on the Event registration page or ticketing portal (e.g., Lu.ma, Eventbrite, etc.).

1.2. You agree to comply with all applicable terms and conditions or codes of conduct set by any third-party platform or venue used to host the Event. If these Terms differ from the specific Event details, the Event-specific information prevails for that Event only.

## 2. Registration and Attendance.

2.1. Registration is required unless stated otherwise. You must provide accurate and complete information when registering.

2.2. We reserve the right to limit attendance capacity or close registration once the capacity is reached.

2.3. Tickets or registrations are personal unless explicitly stated as transferable.

## 3. Payments.

3.1. Where applicable, Event fees are payable at registration through the platform indicated. Unless stated otherwise, Event fees are non-cancellable and non-refundable.

## 4. Event Changes and Cancellations.

4.1. We reserve the right to modify the Event program, speakers, timing, or venue, or switch to an online or hybrid format if necessary due to organizational or external circumstances. We reserve the right to cancel the Event at any time. In such a case, any paid registration fees will be fully refunded. However, Apify will not be liable for changes or cancellations caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disasters, pandemics, governmental restrictions, or technical outages.

4.2. We are not responsible for any services provided by third parties (including, but not limited to, accommodations, transportation, or catering), even if recommended or facilitated by us.

## 5. Conduct and Compliance. 

5.1. We are committed to providing a welcoming and safe environment for all attendees.

5.2. Similarly, you are responsible for:

(i) Treating others with respect and professionalism.
(ii) Following instructions and safety rules provided by Apify or venue staff.
(iii) Adhering to the [Apify Community Code of Conduct](https://docs.apify.com/legal/community-code-of-conduct), as applicable.
(iv) Your compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

5.3. We reserve the right to deny entry or remove any attendee without refund if their behavior is inappropriate, disruptive, or violates these Terms or the rules of any given Event.

## 6. Liability

6.1. You are responsible for any damage you cause to property, equipment, or injury to other participants. Apify accepts no responsibility for loss or theft of personal belongings during the Event.

6.2. Apify is not liable for damages caused by other attendees, third parties, or force majeure events (including but not limited to natural disasters, pandemics, or government restrictions).

6.3. Apify makes no warranties or representations regarding the information or content presented by speakers or other third parties at the Event. All materials are provided on an “as-is” basis. Apify’s maximum aggregate liability to any attendee in connection with the Event shall not exceed the amount of the registration fee paid by that attendee.

## 7. Privacy

7.1. Personal data collected during registration or participation will be processed in accordance with the [Apify Privacy Policy](https://docs.apify.com/legal/privacy-policy). We process this data to manage Event participation, communication, and feedback, and may use third-party service providers (such as event platforms) as processors.

7.2. We may take photographs, videos, or recordings during the Event for documentation, reporting, and promotional purposes, which may be shared publicly (e.g., on websites or social media). If you do not wish to appear in such materials, please notify us in writing before the Event. We will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your request.

## 8. Miscellaneous

8.1. Apify may update these Terms from time to time. The latest version will always be published at docs.apify.com/legal/event-terms-and-conditions. The version in effect at the time of registration applies to your participation.

8.2. These Terms are governed by the laws of the Czech Republic. Any disputes arising from or relating to these Terms shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Czech courts.
