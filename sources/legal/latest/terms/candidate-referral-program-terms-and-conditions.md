Apify Technologies s.r.o., as the announcer (“**Apify**”), is constantly looking for new employees and prefers to recruit people based on credible references.Therefore, Apify is announcing this public candidate referral program.

Apify undertakes that any individual (“**You**”) who:

is neither:

- currently employed by Apify;
- a person who carries out business in human resources;
- a recruiting agency, or a person cooperating with recruiting agency in any other capacity;

and recommends to Apify a suitable job candidate (“**Candidate**”):

- for any open full-time position published on the Apify Job page available at: https://apify.com/jobs;
- who is not already in Apify’s applicant database, and is not active in the recruitment process (in which case you will be informed by Apify);
- with whom Apify concludes an employment contract that establishes full-time employment between Apify and the Candidate (any candidates hired on a “DPP/DPČ” basis are excluded from this program);
- who confirms that he/she was recommended to Apify by you and
- whose employment with Apify is not terminated during the probationary period;

will receive a reward of **CZK 20,000** from Apify for each such Candidate.

If the Candidate is hired in a capacity other than full-time engagement, the reward will be prorated accordingly. If the Candidate transfers from part-time and/or “DPP/DPČ” to full-time engagement, you will not be entitled to any additional reward.

A person will be considered a Candidate recommended by you only if you send the Candidate’s CV and contact details to the email address jobs[at]apify[dot]com. As it’s very important for Apify to respond promptly and avoid any inconveniences, Apify cannot accept any other method of recommendation. Sending resumes and information directly to  jobs[at]apify[dot]com ensures that the entire Apify recruiting team receives the referral and can take care of the Candidate. When submitting the resume, please provide as much supporting information as possible about why Apify should hire the Candidate.

You shall become entitled to the reward after the Candidate’s probationary period successfully passes. Apify will issue a protocol confirming the payout of the reward. Reward payment is based on your signature of the protocol. It is payable by bank transfer to the account specified in the protocol within thirty (30) days from the date of the protocol signature.

Please note that the reward is subject to the applicable taxes. You are solely responsible for any related tax obligations (such as tax returns, etc.).

You may recommend more than one Candidate. If you and someone else recommend one Candidate for the same open position in parallel, the reward will be provided to the individual who recommended the Candidate first for that specific open position.

The current list of open positions is available on the Apify Job page: https://apify.com/jobs.

This Apify Candidate Referral Program is effective from its publication and remains in effect as long as it is published on the website www.apify.com. Apify reserves the right to modify or revoke this Candidate Referral Program and its terms at any time and at its sole discretion by removing it from the website www.apify.com.
