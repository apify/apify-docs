Apify Technologies s.r.o., a company registered in the Czech Republic, with its registered office at Vodičkova 704/36, 110 00 Prague 1, Czech Republic, Company ID No.: 04788290 ("**Apify**", "**we**", "**us**") offers you (also referred to as "**participant**") the opportunity to enroll in the "Apify \$1M Challenge" ("**Challenge**"), which is subject to the following "Apify 1M Challenge Terms and Conditions" ("**Challenge Terms**").

As part of the Challenge requires publishing Actors in Apify Store, the Challenge is further governed by [Apify Store Publishing Terms and Conditions](store-publishing-terms-and-conditions.md) ("**Store Publishing Terms**"), which are incorporated herein by reference. In case of a conflict, these Challenge Terms shall prevail.

Terms starting with a capital letter used in these Challenge Terms have the meaning defined either here or in Store Publishing Terms.

By joining the Challenge, you accept and agree to be bound by these Challenge Terms. If you agree to these Challenge Terms on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Challenge Terms, and your agreement to these Challenge Terms will be treated as the agreement of the entity. In that event, "you", "your", or “participant” refer herein to that entity.

Participation in this Challenge is free and does not require the purchase of any product or service.

## 1. Participant Eligibility

1.1. The Challenge is open to all Apify Users, regardless of whether they are new to Apify or have an existing account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Apify employees, individual contractors, and their immediate family members, as well as those in close relationships with Apify employees or individual contractors (a "close person" as defined by the Czech Civil Code), are not eligible to participate.

1.2. To participate in the Challenge, you must register at https://apify.com/challenge and agree to these Challenge Terms.

1.3. You will be disqualified from the Challenge if you do not comply with Store Publishing Terms or if you conduct any of the following activities:

- Fraud and Gaming: Any attempt to manipulate the Actor Quality score, inflate active user numbers, or engage in any fraudulent activity.
- Spamming: Promote your new Actors via Apify's Discord, Apify Console messaging, or Actor reviews.
- Low-Quality Submissions: Publish too many low-quality or spammy Actors, notwithstanding the fact that you may have published other Actors that are high-quality.

1.4. Individuals or entities are not eligible to participate in the Challenge if they fail our KYC/KYB verification, are listed on any sanctions list, or are incorporated, headquartered, or controlled by residents in Russia.

2.1. Actors published in Apify Store following your registration for the Challenge will be enrolled in the Challenge. Any exceptions to this rule are at our sole discretion.

2.2. Actors must meet a set of "hygienic" criteria, which will be evaluated by us at our sole discretion, such as a unique, legitimate README, a well-defined input and output schema (or using the standby mode), and a minimum "Actor Quality score" of 65/100 as further described in the Documentation. Actor Quality score will be visible in your Insights tab in Apify Console.

2.3. **Ineligible Actors**. The following types of Actors are not eligible for any rewards and may result in disqualification:

- Actors that use third-party software under a license that prohibits commercial use or redistribution of the resulting Actor.
- Actors for scraping the following services or websites:  YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, X, Apollo.io, Amazon, Google Maps, Google Search, Google Trends. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Actors that perform non-scraping functionality (e.g., AI agents, etc.) may be eligible.

## 3. Rewards

3.1. **Challenge Bonus (New Actors Reward)**.

3.1.1. The reward shall be \$2.00 per Monthly Active User. "Monthly Active User" means any User who ran the submitted Actor within the 30 days immediately preceding the calculation date, provided that the activity occurred on or after the eighth (8th) day following that User's signup date. Excluded from this definition are: (i) Apify internal accounts, (ii) test accounts, and (iii) Users blocked by Apify.

3.1.2. The minimum reward is \$100 (at least 50 Monthly Active Users). The maximum reward is \$2,000 (for 1,000 or more Monthly Active Users).

3.1.3. On January 31, 2026, a final usage snapshot will be taken. We will create a list of all submitted Actors that meet all Challenge requirements (Sections 2 and 3), ranked by the highest number of Monthly Active Users.

3.1.4. Payouts will be distributed sequentially, starting with the highest-ranked Actor on the list, and continuing down the list until the total distributed rewards reach the Challenge Bonus Pool of \$920,000. Once the Challenge Bonus Pool is depleted, no further Actors will receive this reward, regardless of their Monthly Active User count.

3.1.5. Every participant can be rewarded in this way for a maximum of 5 Actors.

3.2. **Weekly Spotlight Reward**. Every week starting from November 17, 2025, we will select one exceptional Actor to receive a one-time \$2,000 reward. There are no hard criteria for this reward; it will be either based on the Apify jury's or industry expert's assessment of the Actor's concept, technical solution, or user experience, and/or Apify Community vote. For the avoidance of doubt, Actor requirements and other general conditions according to these Challenge Terms still apply.

3.3. **Top 3 Prizes**. After the Challenge concludes on January 31, 2026, the Apify jury will award a total of \$60,000 to the three top participants who demonstrate the highest overall success in the Challenge. Awards will be distributed as follows:

- First Place: \$30,000
- Second Place: \$20,000
- Third Place: \$10,000.

There are no hard criteria for this reward. For the avoidance of doubt, Actor requirements and other general conditions according to these Challenge Terms still apply.
