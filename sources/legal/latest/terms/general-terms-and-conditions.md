You acknowledge and agree that each Indemnified Person has the right to assert and enforce its rights under this section directly on its own behalf as a third-party beneficiary.

## 10. Legal Disclaimer and Warning

We may immediately suspend your use of the Website, Platform, Configurations and/or Services if we are contacted by your targeted data extraction source, website, or repository and asked to cease all extraction activity. If such an event occurs, we will not disclose your information without a court order mandating us to do so unless we in our best judgment determine that there would be an adverse consequence if we do not. If, however, we receive a court order demanding the release of your information to a third party, we will comply. If such action becomes necessary, you agree to indemnify and hold us and (as applicable) our parent(s), subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, contractors and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party arising from any complaint, suit, disagreement or other repercussions resulting from your use of the Website, Platform, Configurations or Services.

Should any third party claim its rights against us in connection to your actions, we may immediately eliminate any contents gathered, saved or disseminated by you from servers used by us. In the event of a judicial dispute with a third party related to your actions, you are obliged to provide us with all necessary cooperation in order to resolve such a dispute successfully and you are also obliged to reimburse continuously any purposeful expenses arising to us due to such a dispute. With respect to this, should an obligation arise to reimburse any claim of a third party, you agree to pay us the full scope of the damages.

## 11. Payment Terms

Within the scope of your user account on the Website or by means of the Website, you may order a paid license to use the Platform (an extended paid version as opposed to the basic version that is free of charge) or other Services in compliance with the up-to-date information and prices provided for the given license or Service on the Website or as agreed with us individually.

Your orders made by means of the Website shall be binding. By entering the relevant details of your debit or credit card during the order-making process, you agree that the price of the ordered license (including the Overages as defined below) or Service (the price of the ordered license and the price of the ordered Service collectively as the “**Fees**”) shall be deducted from the card.

Unless agreed otherwise, you shall pay the Fees on a monthly or yearly basis or another basis selected when making the order (the “**Billing Period**”). The Billing Period shall commence on the date of your first payment. The Fees are payable at the first date of the Billing Period for which it is valid except for the Overages as provided for in the following paragraph. You agree that the Fees for the relevant Billing Period shall be deducted by us from the debit or credit card the details of which were provided by you when ordering the relevant license.

In case your actual use of the Platform features exceeds your prepaid subscription, you shall be automatically charged for overages in compliance with the up-to-date information and prices provided for the given license or Service on the Website or as agreed with us elsewhere (the “**Overages**”).

Overages not exceeding in aggregate a certain threshold (the "**Overage Threshold**"), will be added as a part of the invoice issued by us at the beginning of the next Billing Period. The default value of the Overage Threshold is USD 200 in any given Billing Period, but it may be modified by us in our sole discretion.

In case you cancel your subscription, the Overages will be invoiced as a part of the final invoice. Any Overages exceeding in aggregate the Overage Threshold in any given Billing Period may be invoiced separately as soon as the Overage Threshold has been reached. For the avoidance of doubt, you may be invoiced for Overages multiple times if you exceed the Overage Threshold according to the previous sentence multiple times in any given Billing Period.

Should you order an upgrade of the license you are currently using, you shall pay the pro rata difference for the previously paid price of the currently used license and the price of the new license for the rest of the current Billing Period. The upgrade shall be performed immediately upon payment of the difference. Should you select a downgrade of the currently used license, you may not request the return of the paid remuneration for the current Billing Period (or its part); until the end of the current Billing Period you may use the license for the version already paid for. Upon the effectiveness of the upgrade or downgrade, the remuneration deducted for the following Billing Period shall amount to the newly selected license version similarly to the definition above.

We are a value-added tax (VAT) payer in compliance with the tax laws of the Czech Republic. VAT shall therefore always be added to the Fees payable in the amount stipulated by the respective tax laws.

The Fees shall always be deemed as paid for when credited to our bank account or our other electronic accounts held with a provider of payment services (e.g., PayPal or Braintree).

We shall not refund any Fees or other amounts paid by you to us.

You hereby agree to pay all applicable Fees and/or charges under these terms, including any applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity, and that we may change its pricing at any time. There are no refunds for payments made once Services have been rendered or license provided. If you dispute any charge made for your use of the Platform, licenses or Services, you must notify us in writing within fifteen (15) days of any such charge; failure to so notify us shall result in the waiver by you of any claim relating to any such disputed charge. Charges shall be calculated solely based on invoicing records maintained by us for purposes of billing. No other measurements or statistics of any kind shall be accepted by us or have any effect under these terms

## 12. Personal Data Protection, Commercial Offers, Confidentiality

Personal Data Protection is regulated by the [Privacy Policy](../policies/privacy-policy.md).

During the term of your use of the Website or Platform, licenses granted under these terms and Services and for a period of two (2) years following the termination or expiration of your subscription, each party agrees not to disclose Confidential Information of the other party to any third party without prior written consent except as provided herein (the "**Confidential Information**"). Confidential Information includes (i) subscription account data, including agent definitions, Customer Data, and User Content, (ii) except as provided in subsection (i) above, any other Website, Platform or Services information or access to technology prior to public disclosure provided by us to you and identified at the time of disclosure in writing as “Confidential.” Confidential Information does not include information that has become publicly known through no breach by a party, or has been (i) independently developed without access to the other party's Confidential Information; (ii) rightfully received from a third party; or (iii) required to be disclosed by law or by a governmental authority.

## 13. Term, Amendment, and Termination

Unless mutually agreed otherwise in writing, the license agreement and the agreement on the provision of other Services concluded by and between us shall be for an indefinite period of time. Either we or you may terminate any such agreement by cancelling your user account on the Platform (user account may be cancelled in the account settings). In the event of the agreement termination or user account cancellation, you shall not be entitled to the refund of any remuneration you already paid to us (see Article 11, Payment Terms).

In the following cases we may further withdraw from an agreement concluded with you (by cancelling your user account) with immediate effect:

- Should you be in delay with payment of any amounts due to us for more than three days;

- Should you breach these Terms and/or Privacy Policy in any way whatsoever (including, but not limited to, the breach of our Copyright, terms of the provided license, terms of use of the Website, Platform or Services, or should you create more than one user account without our prior written consent)

When terminating the license agreement or cancelling your user account, we may eliminate any data entered in the user account and gathered there.

If necessary (including but not limited to the market development, development of the Platform and related technologies and with respect to new risks associated with the Platform and the safety of its use), we may unilaterally amend the version hereof. Similarly, with respect to the market development we may unilaterally amend the remuneration amount of the license for use of the Platform or the remuneration for the Services. We shall notify you of such an amendment at least 30 days in advance before its effectiveness by displaying the notification in your user account or otherwise on the Website or the Platform. Should you disagree with such an amendment, you may withdraw from the relevant agreement effective as at the date of the effectiveness of the announced amendments by cancelling your user account (cancellation may be performed in your account settings). In the event of the agreement termination and user account cancellation you shall not be entitled to a refund of any remuneration paid to us already (see Art. 11, Payment Terms). Provided you shall not cancel your user account before the effective date of the amendment, you shall be deemed to agree with such an amendment.

## 14. Final Provisions

These Terms and any other contracts and legal relationships concluded by and between us (unless otherwise explicitly provided) shall be governed by the laws of the Czech Republic. Any disputes arising here from between us shall be resolved by the courts of general jurisdiction in the Czech Republic.

You agree that we may use your name, company name and logo as a reference in all types of promotion materials for marketing purposes free of charge.

Apify is a trademark of Apify Technologies s.r.o., registered in the United States and other countries.

Provided that we enter into a separate written license agreement or another contract with you provisions of which deviate herefrom, such different provisions shall take precedence over the respective provisions of these Terms.

Should any of the provisions hereof be ascertained as invalid, ineffective or unenforceable, upon mutual agreement such a provision shall be replaced by a provision whose sense and purpose comes as closely as possible to the original provision. The invalidity, ineffectiveness or unenforceability of one provision shall not affect the validity and effectiveness of the remaining provisions hereof.

Unless otherwise provided hereby, any changes and amendments hereto may only be made in writing.
