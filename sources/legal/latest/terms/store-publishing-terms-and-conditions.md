Apify Technologies s.r.o., with its registered seat at Vodičkova 704/36, 110 00 Prague 1, Czech Republic, Company reg. no. 04788290, recorded in the Commercial Register kept by the Municipal Court of Prague, File No.: C 253224 (“**we**” or “**Apify**”) created Apify Store at console.apify.com/store ("**Apify Store**") where you ("**you**") can publish an Actor, as defined in the [Apify General Terms and Conditions](../terms/general-terms-and-conditions.md) and [Actor Terms and Conditions](../terms/actor-terms-and-conditions.md) that are incorporated by reference herein ("**General Terms**"). By publishing an Actor in Apify Store, you represent that you are over 18 years old and agree to adhere to these Apify Store Publishing Terms and Conditions ("**Publishing Terms**"), in addition to the General Terms. If you act on behalf of a company when accepting these Publishing Terms, you also hereby declare to be authorized to perform such legal actions on behalf of the company (herein, the term "you" shall mean the relevant company).

Terms starting with a capital letter used in these Publishing Terms have the meaning defined either here or in the General Terms.

## 1. Publishing your Actor

1.1. Actors can be either private or public. Public Actors are shown in Apify Store and can be accessed and run by any User.

## 2. Actor name, description, and price

2.1. Each Actor has its own unique name. When publishing an Actor, you agree to assign it a relevant and non-deceptive name. You are prohibited from using trademarks, logos, icons, or proprietary branding belonging to any third party—or selecting names that impersonate or are confusingly similar to well-known brands—unless you have express authorization. All Actor listings must be configured to avoid any suggestion of official affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement by a third-party trademark owner. Specifically, you must include a clear and prominent disclaimer stating that the Actor is 'unofficial' and is not affiliated with the third-party service being accessed.

2.2. You agree to create, publish, and maintain an up-to-date, pertinent description, documentation, or other sources of information, allowing Users to use the Actor.

2.3. The Actor, its name, price, description and other information connected to it published in Apify Store can be changed at any time in the future. However, changes to the Actor's price that might potentially lead to a price increase for a User, including pricing model changes, are limited to a maximum of one change per month. Any such changes shall become effective only after fourteen (14) days from the date thereof.

## 3. Competition

3.1. We encourage healthy competition. Creating an Actor that offers similar functionality or outcome as another Actor is permitted. However, you must avoid simply copying another's Actor and claiming it as yours.

3.2. We reserve the right to immediately unpublish and/or delete any Actor that, in our sole discretion, infringes on any rights of other Users and/or third parties, including, but not limited to, copyright infringement caused by copying content of other Users, such as their Actors' readmes, descriptions or parts thereof.

## 4. Prohibited activities

4.1. You may create and publish an Actor of any kind. However, to maintain a safe, legal and respectful environment on the Platform, we are asking you to avoid content and activities that are prohibited by any terms agreed between both parties and the [Acceptable Use Policy](../policies/acceptable-use-policy.md) (the "**Prohibited Activities**").

4.2. You are not allowed to:
(i) unless we explicitly agree to it in writing, directly or indirectly offer, link to, or otherwise promote any product or service outside of the Platform in your Actors (including its accessories, e.g., the “read me” section of the Actor page on the Platform) or in any other content you publish on Apify Store; or
(ii) abuse Apify Store review system, including by offering incentives for reviews, soliciting fake reviews, using multiple accounts to influence ratings, reviewing your own Actor(s), or otherwise artificially inflating or suppressing reviews.

4.3. While we are not obliged to monitor the content of all Actors, if we find out that your Actor:

(i) contains any content falling under the Prohibited Activities;
(ii) has been created (at least in part) by performing the Prohibited Activities; or
(iii) the Actor itself performs any of the Prohibited Activities;

we are authorized to unpublish and/or delete such an Actor or content, in our sole discretion.

Similarly, we reserve the right to delete, unpublish, restrict or modify any unlawful, offensive, harmful, or misleading content or public information in Apify Store or any Actor, including the removal of reviews that violate clause 4.2, as we may see fit to protect our legitimate interests and the integrity of Apify Store.

## 5. Privacy of the code

5.1. By publishing your Actor on Apify Store you are allowing us to view the source code of that Actor. We may only access and inspect the source code in limited circumstances where our interference is necessary for legal, compliance or security reasons, for example, when investigating the presence of any Prohibited Activities.


## 6. Maintenance of the Actor

6.1. By publishing your Actor, you agree to use your best effort to maintain it in working condition and make updates to it from time to time as needed, in order to maintain its continuing functionality.

## 7. Testing

7.1. We are performing regular automated testing of the functionality and performance of all Actors published in Apify Store. Failing the test may lead to the consequences described in clause 9 below.

## 8. Faulty Actor

8.1. If your Actor does not provide the declared functionality (a "**Faulty Actor**") we are authorized to mark that Faulty Actor as “under maintenance” in Apify Store. If you do not update or make changes to the Faulty Actor to recover its functionality and the Actor remains a Faulty Actor for the period of 30 days or more, we are authorized to mark that Faulty Actor as “deprecated” and/or remove that Faulty Actor from Apify Store. You will not be reimbursed for the removal of the Faulty Actor.

## 9. Notified issues with an Actor

9.1. Users have the option to report an issue with an Actor. The issue is then notified to you through the email address associated with your Account. You are responsible for regular monitoring of your email address and should you receive such a notification email about an issue with your Actor, you agree to address the issue by either fixing the issue, updating the Actor, its description or other information, or by contacting us with an explanation as soon as possible, however, no later than within 14 days. If you do not address the notified issue in accordance with this clause, we are authorized to declare your Actor a Faulty Actor.

9.2. In addition to addressing the issues according to clause 9.1 above, you agree to respond to us, should we contact you regarding your Actor via email marked “urgent” in its subject, within three business days.

## 10. Pricing options

10.1. When you decide to set your Actor as monetized, you may choose one of the following pricing models:

(i) "**Monthly Rental**" which means that each User of your Actor will pay a flat monthly rental fee for use of that Actor. You will set the price as X USD per month;
(ii) "**Pay per Result**" which means that each User of your Actor will pay a fee calculated according to the number of results of each run of that Actor. You will set the price as X USD per 1,000 results. In this model, the Users do not pay for the Platform usage; or
(iii) "**Pay per Event**" which allows you to programmatically charge for events in your Actor source code. You need to pre-define the events first when setting the Actor pricing and configure whether Users pay for the Platform usage or not.

10.2. If you set your Actor as monetized, you will be entitled to receive remuneration calculated as follows:

(i) 80% of the sum of the Monthly Rental fees paid by the Users of the Actor; or
(ii) 80% of the sum of Pay per Result or Pay per Event fees paid by the users of the Actor, and may further be reduced by the cost of Platform usage of the corresponding Actor runs, depending on your configuration.

You acknowledge that the remaining portion of the Users' fees paid for the Actor shall belong to us.

_Example: You set the price for your monetized Actor under the Pay per Event model (where “event” is defined as a single result produced) as USD 5 per 1,000 events. The Actor has one paying User who runs it once with 1,000 events. The Platform usage costs of the Actor run, covered by you as per your configuration, are USD 0.5. You will be entitled to remuneration of USD 3.5 (i.e. (80% of 5) - 0.5)._

10.3. You acknowledge that the amount of fees paid by the Users and the Platform usage costs can change throughout the month due to unpaid invoices or refunds, and that any information about future or past profits or remuneration available to you in the Platform UI is only estimate. Apify shall not be liable for the outcomes of any actions made based on those estimates.

## 11. Payment terms and compliance

11.1. You are responsible for providing correct billing details in your user Account and keeping them up-to-date to enable us to make payments to you.

11.2. To receive remuneration from us, you must successfully complete our identity verification and 'Know Your Customer' (KYC) process. This may include providing government-issued identification, proof of address, tax documentation, and ultimate beneficial ownership information.

11.2.1. We shall have no obligation to process, and is expressly prohibited from issuing, any payments to you until you have been fully verified to our satisfaction.

11.2.2. We reserve the right to suspend payouts, terminate your account, and/or forfeit your accrued unpaid balance if: (i) you fail to pass the KYC process in a timely manner; (ii) any provided information is found to be false, misleading, or incomplete; (iii) you or your associated entities appear on any applicable sanctions or watchlists; or (iv) you are flagged as high-risk according to Apify’s internal compliance policies.

11.2.3. Verification is an ongoing obligation. Apify may require updated documentation at any time to comply with evolving laws and regulations; failure to comply with a re-verification request may result in the immediate suspension of payouts.

11.2.4. Any accrued remuneration that remains withheld due to incomplete or failed KYC verification for a continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be deemed abandoned and automatically forfeited in favor of Apify. Apify shall have no obligation to process payouts for such forfeited amounts.

11.3. Your entitlement to remuneration for an Actor will cease for the time that the Actor is a Faulty Actor. If you fix or update the Faulty Actor, and it becomes functional again as advertised, your entitlement to remuneration in relation to the Actor will resume.

11.4. Unless both parties have agreed otherwise, your remuneration will be paid on the basis of an auto-generated invoice available through Platform. The invoice will be issued without undue delay after the end of each calendar month. You may approve or dispute the invoice within 3 days of issuance. An invoice that's neither accepted nor disputed within that period shall be deemed approved.

11.5. The minimum amount payable is USD 20 for PayPal and USD 100 for any other payout option (the "**Minimum payout**"). Remuneration in any given month lower than the Minimum payout will be rolled over to the following month until the sum of approved invoices exceeds the Minimum payout. Attributes of an invoice such as due date do not override the Minimum payout rule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any accrued remuneration that remains below the Minimum Payout for a continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be deemed abandoned and shall be forfeited in favor of Apify. Apify shall have no obligation to process payouts for forfeited amounts.

11.6. We may, in our sole discretion, block, remove, deprecate, or otherwise restrict your Actor from the Platform, if your Actor contains, requires, or refers the Users to any payment method, other than the Apify payment gateway. This includes, without limitation, any method that (i) directly or indirectly circumvents the system of remuneration according to these Publishing Terms; or (ii) poses a security risk to us, the Platform, the Users, or any third party (e.g., by creating a false impression that the User pays any fees or other payments for the Actor to Apify). We reserve the right to withhold any and all outstanding payments due to you for such Actor until we determine whether the Actor complies with these Publishing Terms.

11.7. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Apify reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to reduce, withhold, or completely waive any payout otherwise due to you upon the occurrence of a breach of the Publishing Terms or the General Terms. In the case of review system abuse under clause 4.2, we may retroactively forfeit remuneration earned during any period in which such abuse occurred, and you shall be obligated to refund any amounts already paid that were associated with Actors subject to review manipulation.

11.8. In case any suspicions arise regarding the legitimacy of any User’s payment for your Actor (e.g., suspicions of a fraudulent payment) or if the User is past due with its payment obligations, before we pay you the remuneration for such User’s payment, we shall have the right, but not the obligation, to withhold the remuneration for such User’s payment for a period necessary for us to investigate any suspicious activity related to it or until paid by the User. You agree to provide us and/or any authorized third party (e.g., Stripe) with all reasonably requested cooperation.

11.9. If any fraudulent or otherwise non-compliant activity is identified regarding a User’s account or payments, we may ban the User from using the Platform. If we ban such a User, we shall not be obligated to pay you any remuneration resulting from such a fraudulent User’s payments. In case such activities are identified after we have already paid you the remuneration for such a User's payment, you shall be obligated, at our written request, to refund the corresponding part of the remuneration.

11.10. If a payment of remuneration is withheld in accordance with these Publishing Terms, you shall not be entitled to any interest or additional payments.

## 12. Miscellaneous

12.1. You retain intellectual property rights in your Actor(s). By publishing an Actor on Apify Store, you grant Apify a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, run, display, market, and distribute your Actor.

12.2. We may unilaterally amend these Publishing Terms. We shall notify you of such an amendment in advance. Should you disagree with such an amendment, you may unpublish all your Actors from Apify Store within 30 days from the notification. Otherwise, you will be deemed to agree with the latest version of these Publishing Terms.
