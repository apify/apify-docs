These Actor Terms and Conditions ("**Actor Terms**") outline the specific provisions governing the use of Actors in connection with the Platform and related Services. They are hereby incorporated into the [Apify General Terms and Conditions](../terms/general-terms-and-conditions.md) ("**General Terms**").

By accessing or using any Actors on the Platform, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Actor Terms, in addition to the General Terms. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between these Actor Terms and the General Terms regarding the use of Actors, these Actor Terms shall prevail.

## 1. Definitions

Any capitalized terms not otherwise defined in these Actor Terms shall have the meaning set forth in the General Terms.

1.2. "**Community Actor**" refers to a public Actor (other than an Apify Maintained Actor) developed by any User and made available by such User in Apify Store.

1.3. "**Actor Developer**" refers to a User who creates an Actor through the Platform.

1.4. "**Actor Input**" is any data, input, or parameters provided by you when using an Actor.

1.5. "**Actor Output**" is any intermediate or final data generated during an Actor’s execution, or any data stored by an Actor to Apify or third-party data storage.

## 2. Your Rights and Obligations

2.1. Your use of Actors consumes your prepaid usage and resources, as billed to you according to Apify's pricing as outlined in the Agreement.

2.2. You may use Actors solely for legitimate purposes consistent with their intended functionality and in accordance with these Actor Terms, General Terms (including Apify Acceptable Use Policy), and the respective terms published by the Actor Developer(s) and all applicable laws and regulations.

## 3. Actor Intellectual Property Rights

3.1. Actor Developer reserves all rights, title, and interest, including all Intellectual Property rights in and to their Actor(s).

3.2. You retain all intellectual property rights in your Actor Inputs and Actor Outputs. However, you grant Actor Developer a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to process your Actor Inputs and Actor Outputs as necessary to provide the Actor’s functionality to you.

## 4. Actor Privacy

You acknowledge that Actor Developers shall not be considered our Subprocessors as defined in the [Apify Data Processing Addendum](../terms/data-processing-addendum.md).

4.2. For Community Actors, you should also review any privacy policies or data handling practices provided by the respective Actor Developer, as they may have direct access to or control over the Actor Inputs and Actor Outputs processed by their Actors.

4.3. Unless the parties agree otherwise, all Actors are intended for the processing of non-confidential, non-proprietary information. Any Actor Outputs retrieved by you and processed through the Platform are considered Customer Data.

## 5. Disclaimer of Warranties

5.1. All Actors are provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE”. Your use of any Actor is at your sole risk. Apify expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

IN NO EVENT SHALL APIFY BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF APIFY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM: (i) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE ANY ACTOR; (ii) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION, OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH OR FROM ANY ACTOR; (iii) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR ACTOR INPUTS AND ACTOR OUTPUTS.
