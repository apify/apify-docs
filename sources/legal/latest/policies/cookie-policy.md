This Cookie Policy (the “**Policy**” or “**Cookie Policy**”) describes the way we use cookies on our Website and on our platform on console.apify.com (the “**Platform**”). Terms starting with a capital letter used in this Policy have the meaning defined in our [General Terms and Conditions](../terms/general-terms-and-conditions.md) (the “**Terms**”). By accessing the Website, Platform or using our Services, you acknowledge and agree to this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use the Website, Platform or any of our Services. Each time you use the Website, Platform or our Services, the current version of the Cookie Policy will apply.

## Cookies

When you access our Website, Platform or use our Services, we may collect information regarding your IP address for the purposes of administering the Website or Platform and tracking Website or Platform usage. However, your IP address may vary each time you visit, or it may remain the same depending on the type of Internet connection you are using or the location from which you access the Website or Platform.

We may also collect information about the websites that directed you to our Website or Platform after you clicked on a text or banner link or an ad from another website, or the day and time you visited our Website or Platform and how long you spent on the Website or Platform. We aggregate such information to help us to compile reports as to trends and other behavior about users visiting our Website. However, such information is anonymous and cannot be tied directly to you.

We may also use “cookies” and your personal information to enhance your experience on the Website, Platform and with the Services and to provide you with personalized offers. A cookie is a small data file placed on your computer's hard drive that contains information that allows us to track your activity on the Website or Platform. The cookie itself does not contain any personal information; however, if you provide us with any personal information, the cookie may act as an identifier to tie your personal information to your IP address or computer. You may choose to delete cookies from your computer's hard drive at any time or to disable cookies on your computer. If you delete cookies that relate to the Website, we may not be able to identify you upon your return to the Website. Additionally, if you disable your computer's cookies, you may not be able to access certain features of the Website, Platform or Services that require that cookies be enabled.

The Website's or Platform's cookies cannot be used to read data from your hard drive and cannot retrieve information from any other cookies created by other websites. Additionally, our cookies cannot be used as a virus, Trojan horse, worm, or any other malicious tool that could impair your use of your computer. Our cookies are used to help us better understand how you and other users use the Website or Platform, so we can continue to provide a better, more personalized user experience on the Website. We also share website usage information about our Website or Platform with those interested in running targeted promotional campaigns on the Website. For this purpose, we and our advertisers track some of the pages that you visit on the Website through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs).

## What types of cookies do we use?

### Strictly Necessary Cookies

These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.

### Performance Cookies

These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources, so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.

### Functional Cookies

These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.

### Targeting Cookies

These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.

## How long do cookies last?

None of our cookies last forever. You can always choose to delete cookies from your computer at any time. Even if you do not delete them yourself, our cookies are set to expire automatically after some time. Some cookies will be deleted as soon as you close your browser (so-called “session cookies”), some cookies will stay on your device until you delete them or they expire (so called “persistent cookies”). You can see from the table below the lifespan of each type of cookie that we use; session cookies are those marked with 0 days' expiration, all other cookies are persistent, and you can see the number of days they last before they automatically expire. The expiration periods work on a rolling basis, i.e., each time you visit our website again, the period restarts.

This enables site owners to prevent cookies in each category from being set in the user's browser, when consent is not given.

It contains no information that can identify the site visitor. | Strictly necessary | 364                  |
