# Apify Community Code of Conduct


Effective Date: August 18, 2025

---

## Overview and Purpose

Apify community is intended to be a place for further collaboration, support, and brainstorming. This is a civilized place for connecting with other users, learning new skills, sharing feedback and ideas, and finding all the support you need for your Apify projects. By participating in the Apify community, you are agreeing to the [Apify General Terms and Conditions](../terms/general-terms-and-conditions.md) that apply to use of our Website and Services, as well as this Apify Community Code of Conduct.
With this Apify Community Code of Conduct, we hope to help you understand how best to collaborate in the Apify community, what you can expect from moderators, and what type of actions or content may result in temporary or permanent suspension from community participation. We will investigate any abuse reports and may moderate public content within the Apify community that we determine to be in violation of either the Apify General Terms and Conditions or this Apify Community Code of Conduct.
Our diverse user base brings different perspectives, ideas, and experiences, and ranges from people who created their first "Hello World" project last week to the most well-known software developers in the world. We are committed to making Apify an environment that welcomes all the different voices and perspectives our community has to offer, while maintaining a safe place for developers to do their best work.

## Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in the Apify community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Standards

Treat the Apify community with respect. We are a shared resource, a place to share skills, knowledge, and interests through ongoing conversation.
The following are not hard and fast rules, merely aids to the human judgment of our community. Use these guidelines to keep this a clean, well-lighted place for civilized public discourse.

### Best practices for maintaining a strong community

We are committed to maintaining a community where users are free to express themselves and challenge one another's ideas, both technical and otherwise. At the same time, it's important that users remain respectful and allow space for others to contribute openly. In order to foster both a safe and productive environment, we encourage our community members to look to these guidelines to inform how they interact on our platform. Below, you’ll find some suggestions for how to have successful interactions as a valued member of the Apify community.

- **Engage with consideration and respect**.
  - **Be welcoming and open-minded**. - New users join our community each day. Some are well-established developers, while others are just beginning. Be open to other ideas and experience levels. Make room for opinions other than your own and be welcoming to new collaborators and those just getting started.
  - **Be respectful**. - Working in a collaborative environment means disagreements may happen. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Share thoughtful, constructive criticism and be courteous to those you interact with. If you’re unable to engage respectfully, consider taking a step back or using some of our moderation tools to deescalate a tense situation.
  - **Be empathetic**. - Apify is a global community with people from a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, many of which may not be your own. Try to put yourself in others’ shoes and understand their feelings before you address them. Do your best to help make Apify a community where others feel safe to make contributions, participate in discussions, and share different ideas.
- **Contribute in a positive and constructive way**.
  - **Improve the discussion**. Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later. The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.
  - **Be clear and stay on topic**. The Apify community is for collaboration, sharing ideas, and helping each other get stuff done. Off-topic comments are a distraction (sometimes welcome, but usually not) from getting work done and being productive. Staying on topic helps produce positive and productive discussions.
  This applies to sharing links, as well. Any links shared in Apify community discussions should be shared with the intent of providing relevant and appropriate information. Links should not be posted to simply drive traffic or attention to a site. Links should always be accompanied by a full explanation of the content and purpose of the link. Posting links, especially unsolicited ones, without relevant and valuable context, can come across as advertising or serving even more malicious purposes.
  - **Share mindfully**. When asking others to give you feedback or collaborate on a project, only share valuable and relevant resources to provide context. Don't post links that don't add value to the discussion, and don't post unsolicited links to your own projects or sites on other user's threads.
  Additionally, don't share sensitive information. This includes your own email address. We don't allow the sharing of such information in Apify community, as it can create security and privacy risks for the poster, as well as other users.
  - **Keep it tidy**. Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less time cleaning up. So:
    - Don’t start a discussion in the wrong category.
    - Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple discussions.
    - Don’t post no-content replies.
    - Don't "bump" posts, unless you have new and relevant information to share.
    - Don’t divert a discussion by changing it midstream.
- **Be trustworthy**.
  - **Always be honest**. Don’t knowingly share incorrect information or intentionally mislead other Apify community participants. If you don’t know the answer to someone’s question but still want to help, you can try helping them research or find resources instead. Apify staff will also be active in Apify community, so if you’re unsure of an answer, it’s likely a moderator will be able to help.

## What is not allowed

The [Apify Acceptable Use Policy](acceptable-use-policy.md), which is part of [Apify General Terms and Conditions](../terms/general-terms-and-conditions.md), sets a baseline for what is not allowed on Apify. Since Apify community is on apify.com, these terms and restrictions apply to Apify community, including the following restrictions:

- **Anyone under the age of 18**. If you're under the age of 18, you may not have an account on Apify. Apify does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 18. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 18, we will unfortunately have to close your user account. We don't want to discourage you from learning to code, but those are the rules. Please see Apify General Terms and Conditions for information about account termination.
- **Creating new account after account restriction**. Apify General Terms and Conditions state that "each user may create and use one user account at the most" Additional user accounts created to inquire about flagged or suspended accounts in Apify will be removed.
- **Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting**. Apify community is a professional space and should be treated as such.
- **Violation of General Terms and Conditions**. If your user account is identified in violation of [Apify General Terms and Conditions](../terms/general-terms-and-conditions.md) we will have to close your user account.

## Reasonable use of AI generated content

We love experimenting with new technologies. But as with all new technology, many of us are still getting accustomed to using generative AI tools the most effectively. Here are important guidelines to follow when using generative AI to answer questions in the community:

- Take personal responsibility for everything you post.
- Read and revise the content before you post it; use your own authentic voice.
- Use your expertise as a developer to verify that the answer works and makes sense.
- Do not just post AI-generated content verbatim to inflate your reputation or give a false impression of product expertise.
- AI tools will often answer in an authoritative tone that sounds like a tech support professional. Be careful not to mislead other users into thinking that this authoritative tone means they are receiving an official response from Apify.

Additionally, all of the guidelines listed in the previous section (Best Practices for Maintaining a Strong Community) also apply here.

The community is here for users to build trust through authentic reputations. Not adhering to these guidelines may, in some cases, constitute a Apify Community Code of Conduct violation. Refer to the enforcement section below for more information.

## Enforcement

### **What Apify community participants can do**

**If you see a problem, report it**. Moderators have special authority; they are responsible for the Apify community. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.

When you see bad behavior, don’t reply. It encourages bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. You can report a disruptive user or disruptive content to Apify through our contact email support@apify.com.

## **Our responsibilities**

There are a variety of actions that we may take in response to inappropriate behavior or content. It usually depends on the exact circumstances of a particular case. We recognize that sometimes people may say or do inappropriate things for any number of reasons. Perhaps they did not realize how their words would be perceived. Or maybe they just let their emotions get the best of them. Of course, sometimes, there are folks who just want to spam or cause trouble.

Each case requires a different approach, and we try to tailor our response to meet the needs of the situation. We'll review each situation on a case-by-case basis. In each case, we will have a diverse team investigate the content and surrounding facts and respond as appropriate, using this Apify Community Code of Conduct to guide our decision.
Actions we may take in response to a flag or abuse report include, but are not limited to:

- Content removal
- Content blocking
- Apify user account suspension
- Apify user account termination.

Apify community moderators who do not follow or enforce the Apify Community Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the Apify community's leadership.

## Contacting Apify Staff

If you encounter a violation of our Apify Community Code of Conduct before Apify staff sees it, please let us know right away by at-mentioning a member of our team or by sending an email to community@apify.com.

We'll review, investigate, and respond to complaints promptly and fairly, and we'll take any necessary and appropriate actions. If helpful to the community as a whole, we may post further details of specific enforcement policies, decision-making processes, or updated guidelines. We put your privacy and security first, and we'll respect the privacy of anyone who submits a report.

## Legal Notices
