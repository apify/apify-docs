# Apify Privacy Policy

<!-- vale off -->

Last Updated: September 12, 2024

Welcome to the Apify Privacy Policy!

Apify Technologies s.r.o. ("**Apify**," "**we**," "**our**" or "**us**") operates website apify.com (“**Website**”), provides its customers with the computer platform “Apify” (the "**Platform**") and some other services and functions, as specified in the [Apify General Terms and Conditions](../terms/general-terms-and-conditions.md) (the "**Services**").

Apify is committed to transparency in our processing of information. This is where we describe how we handle your personal data. “**Personal data**” is any information that is directly linked or can be linked to you. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy will have the meaning outlined in the [Apify General Terms and Conditions](../terms/general-terms-and-conditions.md).

## When the Privacy Policy applies

Please note that this Privacy Policy applies where Apify is a “data controller” of your personal data. This includes when we collect information from and about visitors to our websites, prospective users and customers, and users of the Platform, collectively referred to herein as “**you**.”

## When the Privacy Policy does not apply

You may collect and manage personal data when using Platform or other Services. In such a scenario, Apify is a “**data processor**", not a “**data controller**” (as defined by applicable privacy laws) of personal data that we process under your instructions and on your behalf. For clarity, this Privacy Policy does not apply to where Apify processes personal data as a data processor. Such processing activities are governed by a separately executed data processing agreement(s) between Apify and you. We are not responsible for your privacy or data security practices. You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights, consents, or other legal basis for processing such personal data and instructing us to process them on your behalf.

This Privacy Policy also does not apply to personal data about current and former Apify employees, job candidates, or contractors and agents acting in similar roles.

**PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR PERSONAL DATA. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.**

# Third-Party Links and Features

The Website and Platform may contain links to third-party websites and features (such as the share and/or "like" button or interactive mini-programs). These features may collect your IP address, and which page you are visiting on our sites and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. These features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these features. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy and other policies of the companies providing them. Those websites may have their own privacy policies or no privacy policies at all. Apify is not responsible for those websites, and we provide the links solely for your convenience.

# International Transfer of Your Personal Data

Your personal data is maintained and processed by us and our third-party service providers in the European Union and the United States and may also be maintained, processed, and stored in other jurisdictions that may have different data protection laws than those in your country of residence. If your information is transferred in these ways, please note that we comply with applicable legal requirements governing the transfer of information across borders. By using the Platform or Services, you agree to and acknowledge these transfers.

# How We Protect Your Personal Data

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of personal data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage, and processing practices, security measures, and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.

We restrict access to collected information to Apify employees, service providers, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations. If you wish to learn more about our security practices, please see our Security Whitepaper.​

If you become aware of or suspect any unauthorized use of your Apify account, please contact us immediately using the information in the "Contact Us" section below.

# Children and Privacy

Our Website, Platform, and Services are not directed to children, and we will not request personal data from anyone who we know to be under the age of 18 unless we have obtained verifiable parental consent from a parent or legal guardian. If we become aware that a user under the age of 18 has registered with our Website, Platform, or Services, provided personal data, and Apify has not obtained prior verifiable consent from a parent or legal guardian, we will immediately remove the user’s personal data from our files.

# Aggregate Data

Apify may also collect aggregate data. Aggregate data does not contain any personal data. It only contains usage statistics about your activities on the Website and Platform or in connection with the Services that cannot be used to identify, locate, or contact you (such as frequency of visits to the Website, data entered when using the Website, Website pages most frequently accessed, browser type, etc.).
Generally, aggregate information is used collectively, and no single person can be identified by that compiled information. Apify uses aggregate information to provide its Services, determine the use of our Website (Platform), and monitor, audit, and analyze information pertaining to our business metrics.
We may use aggregate information to improve the Website and Services, to monitor traffic and general usage patterns, and for other general business purposes. We may disclose aggregate information to third parties for various business reasons. Aggregate information will not include any personal information, and we will not disclose any personal information except as expressly stated elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.

# Territory-Specific Terms

## EEA and the UK

### Legal Basis for Processing

The legal bases for using your personal data as set out in this Privacy Policy are as follows:

* Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you for the Services
* Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights, do not override those interests
* Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation
* Where we have your consent to process your personal data in a certain way

### Your Data Protection Rights

Under applicable data protection laws, you may exercise certain rights regarding your personal data:

* Right to Access. You have the right to obtain confirmation from us whether we are processing your personal data, as well as the right to obtain a copy of your personal data undergoing processing.
* Right to Data Portability. You may receive the personal data that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and you may have the right to transmit it to other data controllers without hindrance. This right only exists if the processing is based on your consent or a contract and is carried out by automated means.

* Right to Objection. In some instances, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data.

* Right to Not Be Subject to Automated Decision-making. The types of automated decision-making referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) EU/UK General Data Protection Regulation (“**GDPR**”) do not take place in connection with your personal data. Should this change, we will inform you about why and how any such decision was made, the significance of it, and the possible consequences of it.

You may exercise these rights by contacting us using the details provided in Section “Contact Us” below. Please note that we may refuse to act on requests to exercise data protection rights in certain cases, such as where providing access might infringe someone else’s privacy rights or impact our legal obligations.

### International Transfers of Personal Data

Due to the global nature of our operations, some of the recipients mentioned in Section 2 of the Notice may be located in countries outside the EEA, or the U.K., which do not provide an adequate level of data protection as defined by data protection laws in the EEA, and the U.K. Transfers to third parties located in such third countries take place using a valid data transfer mechanism, such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses and/or the U.K. Addendum to such clauses, on the basis of permissible statutory derogations, or any other valid data transfer mechanism issued or approved by the EEA, or U.K. authorities. Certain third countries have been officially recognized by the EEA, and U.K. authorities as providing an adequate level of protection and no further safeguards are necessary. Please reach out to us using the contact information in Section “Contact Us” below, if you wish to receive further information about how we transfer personal data or, where available, a copy of the relevant data transfer mechanism.
