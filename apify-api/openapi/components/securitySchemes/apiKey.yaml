  _When is authentication required?_
  - _Required_ for private Actors, tasks, or resources (e.g., builds of private Actors).
  - _Required_ when using named formats for IDs (e.g., `username~store-name` for stores or `username~queue-name` for queues).
  - _Optional_ for public Actors or resources (e.g., builds of public Actors can be queried without a token).
