  Bearer token provided in the `Authorization` header (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer your_token`â€”recommended). [More info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization).
  
  Use your API token to authenticate requests. You can find it on the [Integrations page](https://console.apify.com/account#/integrations) in Apify Console. This method is more secure than query parameters, as headers are not logged in browser history or server logs.
  
  :::danger Security
  
  Do not share your API token (or account password) with untrusted parties.

  _When is authentication required?_
  - _Required_ for private Actors, tasks, or resources (e.g., builds of private Actors).
  - _Required_ when using named formats for IDs (e.g., `username~store-name` for stores or `username~queue-name` for queues).
  - _Optional_ for public Actors or resources (e.g., builds of public Actors can be queried without a token).
