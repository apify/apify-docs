    The API endpoints described in this section enable you to manage, build and run
    Apify actors.

    For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors">Actor
    documentation</a>.


    Note that for all the API endpoints that accept the `actorId` parameter to specify
    an actor,

    you can pass either the actor ID (e.g. `HG7ML7M8z78YcAPEB`) or a tilde-separated

    username of the actor owner and the actor name (e.g. `janedoe~my-actor`).


    Some of the API endpoints return runs objects. Note that if any such run object
    contains usage in dollars, your effective unit pricing at the time of query

    has been used for computation of this dollar equivalent, and hence it should be
    used only for informative purposes. You can learn more

    about platform usage in the <a href="https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/usage-and-resources#usage">documentation</a>.

    The `sourceType` property indicates where the source code is hosted, and based

    on its value the Version object has the following additional property:

        <td><code>"SOURCE_FILES"</code></td>

            Source code is comprised of multiple files specified in the <code>sourceFiles</code>

    This is not a single endpoint, but an entire group of endpoints that lets you
    to

    retrieve and manage the last run of given actor or any of its default storages.

    All the endpoints require an authentication token.


    The endpoints accept the same HTTP methods and query parameters as

    the respective storage endpoints.

    The base path represents the last actor run object is:


    `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last{?token,status}`


    Using the `status` query parameter you can ensure to only get a run with a certain
    status

    (e.g. `status=SUCCEEDED`). The output of this endpoint and other query parameters

    are the same as in the [Run object](#/reference/actors/run-object) endpoint.


    In order to access the default storages of the last actor run, i.e. log, key-value
    store, dataset and request queue,

    use the following endpoints:


    * `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/log{?token,status}`


    * `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/key-value-store{?token,status}`


    * `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/dataset{?token,status}`


    * `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/request-queue{?token,status}`


    These API endpoints have the same usage as the equivalent storage endpoints.

    For example,

    `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/key-value-store` has the same HTTP method and parameters
    as the

    [Key-value store object](#/reference/key-value-stores/store-object) endpoint.


    Additionally, each of the above API endpoints supports all sub-endpoints

    of the original one:


    #### Key-value store


    * `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/key-value-store/keys{?token,status}` [Key collection](#/reference/key-value-stores/key-collection)


    * `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/key-value-store/records/{recordKey}{?token,status}`
    [Record](#/reference/key-value-stores/record)


    #### Dataset


    * `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/dataset/items{?token,status}` [Item collection](#/reference/datasets/item-collection)


    #### Request queue


    * `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/request-queue/requests{?token,status}` [Request
    collection](#/reference/request-queues/request-collection)


    * `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/request-queue/requests/{requestId}{?token,status}`
    [Request collection](#/reference/request-queues/request)


    * `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/request-queue/head{?token,status}` [Queue head](#/reference/request-queues/queue-head)


    For example, to download data from a dataset of the last succeeded actor run in
    XML format,

    send HTTP GET request to the following URL:


    ```

    https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/dataset/items?token={yourApiToken}&format=xml&status=SUCCEEDED

    ```


    In order to save new items to the dataset, send HTTP POST request with JSON payload
    to the same URL.

    This section describes API endpoints to manage Key-value stores.

    Key-value store is a simple storage for saving and reading data records or files.

    Each data record is represented by a unique key and associated with a MIME content
    type.

    Key-value stores are ideal for saving screenshots, actor inputs and outputs, web
    pages,

    PDFs or to persist the state of crawlers.

    For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/key-value-store">Key-value
    store documentation</a>.


    Note that some of the endpoints do not require the authentication token, the calls

    are authenticated using a hard-to-guess ID of the key-value store.

    This section describes API endpoints to manage Datasets.


    Dataset is a storage for structured data, where each record stored has the same
    attributes,

    such as online store products or real estate offers. You can imagine it as a table,

    where each object is a row and its attributes are columns. Dataset is an append-only

    storage - you can only add new records to it but you cannot modify or remove existing

    records. Typically it is used to store crawling results.

    For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/dataset">Datasets
    documentation</a>.


    Note that some of the endpoints do not require the authentication token, the calls

    are authenticated using the hard-to-guess ID of the dataset.

    This section describes API endpoints to manage request queues.

    Request queue is a storage for a queue of HTTP URLs to crawl, which is typically
    used for deep crawling of websites where you

    start with several URLs and then recursively follow links to other pages.

    The storage supports both breadth-first and depth-first crawling orders.

    For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/request-queue">Request
    queue documentation</a>.


    Note that some of the endpoints do not require the authentication token, the calls

    are authenticated using the hard-to-guess ID of the queue.

    This section describes API endpoints to manage webhooks.


    Webhooks provide an easy and reliable way to configure the Apify platform

    to carry out an action (e.g. a HTTP request to another service) when a certain
    system event occurs.

    For example, you can use webhooks to start another actor when an actor run finishes
    or fails.

    For more information see <a href="https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/webhooks">Webhooks
    documentation</a>.

    This section describes API endpoints for managing schedules.


    Schedules are used to automatically start your actors at certain times. Each schedule
    can be associated with a number of actors and actor tasks. It is also possible

    to override the settings of each actor (task) similarly to when invoking the actor
    (task) using the API.

    For more information, see <a href="https://docs.apify.com/platform/schedules">Schedules
    documentation</a>.


    Each schedule is assigned actions for it to perform. Actions can be of two types
    - `RUN_ACTOR` and `RUN_ACTOR_TASK`. For details, see the documentation of the

    [Get schedule](#/reference/schedules/schedule-object/get-schedule) endpoint.
