    Gets the list of webhooks that the user created.


    The endpoint supports pagination using the `limit` and `offset` parameters
    and it will not return more than 1000 records.

    By default, the records are sorted by the `createdAt` field in ascending
    order. To sort the records in descending order, use the `desc=1`

    parameter.

  summary: Create webhook
  description: |
    Creates a new webhook with settings provided by the webhook object passed as
    JSON in the payload.

    The response is the created webhook object.


    To avoid duplicating a webhook, use the `idempotencyKey` parameter in the
    request body.

    Multiple calls to create a webhook with the same `idempotencyKey` will only
    create the webhook with the first call and return the existing webhook on
    subsequent calls.

    Idempotency keys must be unique, so use a UUID or another random string with
    enough entropy.


    To assign the new webhook to an actor or task, the request body must contain
    `requestUrl`, `eventTypes`, and `condition` properties.


    * `requestUrl` is the webhook's target URL, to which data is sent as a POST
    request with a JSON payload.


    * `eventTypes` is a list of events that will trigger the webhook, e.g. when
    the actor run succeeds.


    * `condition` should be an object containing the ID of the actor or task to
    which the webhook will be assigned.


    * `payloadTemplate` is a JSON-like string, whose syntax is extended with the
    use of variables.


    * `headersTemplate` is a JSON-like string, whose syntax is extended with the
    use of variables. Following values will be re-written to defaults: "host",
    "Content-Type", "X-Apify-Webhook", "X-Apify-Webhook-Dispatch-Id",
    "X-Apify-Request-Origin"


    * `description` is an optional string.


    * `shouldInterpolateStrings` is a boolean indicating whether to interpolate
    variables contained inside strings in the `payloadTemplate`

    **Important**: The request must specify the `Content-Type: application/json`
    HTTP header.
