    Gets the list of schedules that the user created.

    The endpoint supports pagination using the `limit` and `offset` parameters.
    It will not return more than 1000 records.

    By default, the records are sorted by the `createdAt` field in ascending
    order. To sort the records in descending order, use the `desc=1` parameter.

    Creates a new schedule with settings provided by the schedule object passed
    as JSON in the payload. The response is the created schedule object.

    The request needs to specify the `Content-Type: application/json` HTTP header!

    When providing your API authentication token, we recommend using the
    request's `Authorization` header, rather than the URL. ([More
