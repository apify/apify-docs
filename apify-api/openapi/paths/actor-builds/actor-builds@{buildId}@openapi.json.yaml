  summary: Get OpenAPI definition
  description: |
    Get the OpenAPI definition for Actor builds. Two similar endpoints are available:

    - [First endpoint](/api/v2/act-openapi-json-get): Requires both `actorId` and `buildId`. Use `default` as the `buildId` to get the OpenAPI schema for the default Actor build.
    - [Second endpoint](/api/v2/actor-build-openapi-json-get): Requires only `buildId`.

    Get the OpenAPI definition for a specific Actor build.
    Authentication is based on the build's unique ID. No authentication token is required.

    :::note

    You can also use the [`/api/v2/act-openapi-json-get`](/api/v2/act-openapi-json-get) endpoint to get the OpenAPI definition for a build.
