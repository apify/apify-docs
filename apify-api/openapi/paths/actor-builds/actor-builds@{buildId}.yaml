  summary: Get build
  description: |
    Gets an object that contains all the details about a specific build of an
    Actor.

    By passing the optional `waitForFinish` parameter the API endpoint will
    synchronously wait for the build to finish. This is useful to avoid periodic
    polling when waiting for an Actor build to finish.

    This endpoint does not require the authentication token. Instead, calls are authenticated using a hard-to-guess ID of the build. However,
    if you access the endpoint without the token, certain attributes, such as `usageUsd` and `usageTotalUsd`, will be hidden.

        The maximum number of seconds the server waits for the build to finish.
        By default it is `0`, the maximum value is `60`.

        <!-- MAX_ACTOR_JOB_ASYNC_WAIT_SECS -->

        If the build finishes in time then the returned build object will have a
        terminal status (e.g. `SUCCEEDED`), otherwise it will have a transitional status (e.g. `RUNNING`).
