  summary: Get list of builds
  description: |
    Gets the list of builds of a specific Actor. The response is a JSON with the
    list of objects, where each object contains basic information about a single build.


    The endpoint supports pagination using the `limit` and `offset` parameters
    and it will not return more than 1000 records.


    By default, the records are sorted by the `startedAt` field in ascending order,
    therefore you can use pagination to incrementally fetch all builds while new
    ones are still being started. To sort the records in descending order, use
    the `desc=1` parameter.
