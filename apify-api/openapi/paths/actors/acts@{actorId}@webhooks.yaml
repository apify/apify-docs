  summary: Get list of webhooks
  description: |
    Gets the list of webhooks of a specific Actor. The response is a JSON with
    the list of objects, where each object contains basic information about a single webhook.

    The endpoint supports pagination using the `limit` and `offset` parameters
    and it will not return more than 1000 records.

    By default, the records are sorted by the `createdAt` field in ascending
    order, to sort the records in descending order, use the `desc=1` parameter.
