# Actors

Actors are serverless cloud programs that can do almost anything a human can do in a web browser. They can do anything from small tasks like filling in forms or unsubscribing from online services, all the way up to scraping and processing vast numbers of web pages.

You can use actors [manually in the Apify Console](https://console.apify.com/actors), using [API](/api/v2) or [scheduler]({{@link schedules.md}}). You can easily [integrate them with other apps]({{@link integrations.md}}) and share your actors with other Apify users via our [access rights]({{@link access_rights.md}}) system.

> New to Apify? [Try actors with our **quick start** tutorial]({{@link tutorials/quick_start.md}}).

A single isolated actor consists of source code and various settings. You can think of an actor as a cloud app or service that runs on the Apify platform. The run of an actor is not limited to the lifetime of a single HTTP transaction. It can run for as long as necessary, even forever.

## Public, private, and paid actors

Actors can be public (free or [paid]({{@link actors/paid_actors.md}})) or private. Private actors are yours to use and keep, and no one will see them if you don't want them to. Public actors are [available to everyone]({{@link actors/publishing.md}}) in [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store). You can make them free to use, or you can [charge for them](https://blog.apify.com/make-regular-passive-income-developing-web-automation-actors-b0392278d085/).
