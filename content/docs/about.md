# [](#what-is-apify) What is Apify?

Apify is an online platform specializing in [web scraping]({{@link web_scraping_101.md}}), data processing and [robotic process automation]({{@link robotic_process_automation.md}}).

[Apify Store](https://apify.com/store) includes a range of ready-made tools such as **Booking Scraper** ([dtrungtin/booking-scraper](https://apify.com/dtrungtin/booking-scraper)), **SEO Audit Tool** ([drobnikj/seo-audit-tool](https://apify.com/drobnikj/seo-audit-tool)), or the **Google Sheets Import & Export** ([lukaskrivka/google-sheets](https://apify.com/lukaskrivka/google-sheets)) tool. You can try all of these for free right now.

If your needs are more specific, you can order a [custom solution](https://apify.com/custom-solutions) from [us](https://apify.com/enterprise), our partners or [Apify-approved developers](https://apify.com/partners/freelancers).

It introduces how web scraping can help your business and serves as a foundation on how to start using other ready-made actors.

## [](#how-does-apify-work) How does Apify work?

Almost everything we do is centered around [actors]({{@link actors.md}}). Actors are cloud programs that can scrape web pages, process data, automate workflows or anything else you can imagine.

You can learn more about actors from their [documentation]({{@link actors.md}}).
