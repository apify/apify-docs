# [](#web-scraping-101) Web scraping 101

Web scraping is the process of extracting structured information from a web page. In essence, web scraping automates the process of manually finding and copy/pasting the information on a website you find useful.

In other words, instead of manually visiting each of the 1000 listings for white T-shirts on an e-commerce site and copy-pasting each listing's price, description and seller information, you can create a bot that does it for you. You can then make your bot return the data in a handy format like JSON, HTML or Excel, so you could process and use it.

1. The scraper [requests](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/http-requests) the contents of a particular page from a website (e.g. this week's Top 10 singles on Spotify). The site returns it in [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) format.
2. It [parses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) (splits up the data and converts it to the required format) the HTML and extracts the data it's been programmed to extract (e.g. the song title and artist name).
3. The scraper stores the data in the specified format, so you can use it manually or in a program.
