# Building public actors

There are four main stages of building a public actor:

1. [Development]({{@link actors/development.md}}).
2. [Publication]({{@link actors/publishing.md}}).
3. [Testing and maintenance]({{@link actors/development/testing_and_maintenance.md}}).
4. [Promotion]({{@link actors/publishing/seo_and_promotion.md}}).

While you don't have to maintain private actors, public actors are a more long-term project. Be prepared to stick with the project for at least a few months. Ensure you have enough time to maintain the project (~2 hours weekly). With this perspective, you will be able to monetize and promote your actors better.

If your code is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com), its quality is a priority since your actors may be a new user's first and critical contact with Apify. Code should be open to changes and updates – don't fear to refactor. Beware of breaking changes, though! If you do a breaking change, communicate it to all existing users with an explanation.

Documentation is vital (your actor's README). It should be clear, detailed, and readable. Think of the users, who might not be developers, so use simple, easy-to-understand language and avoid technical jargon.

Ensure periodic testing. You can either do it yourself or [set up automatic tests]({{@link actors/development/testing_and_maintenance.md}}) / [monitoring](https://apify.com/apify/monitoring). Try to prevent your users from coming to you with the issues.

## Inspiration

To come up with ideas for new actors, you can use your own experience with friends, colleagues, customers. Alternatively, you can use SEO tools that might help you find the right search terms, websites related to web scraping, web automation, or web integrations. See the [SEO article]({{@link actors/publishing/seo_and_promotion.md}}) for more details.
