# [](#executing-scripts) Executing scripts

An important concept to understand when dealing with headless browsers is the **context** in which your code is being run. For example, if you try to use the native `fs` Node.js module (used in the previous lesson) while running code in the context of the browser, errors will be thrown saying that it is undefined. Similarly, if you are trying to use `document.querySelector()` or other browser-specific functions in the server-side Node.js context, errors will also be thrown.

![Diagram explaining the two different contexts your code can be run in]({{@asset puppeteer_playwright/images/context-diagram.webp}});

Here is an example of a common mistake made by beginners to Puppeteer/Playwright:

```JavaScript
// This code is incorrect!
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
const page = await browser.newPage();

// visit google
await page.goto('https://google.com/');

// change background to green
document.body.style.background = 'green';

await page.waitForTimeout(10000)

await browser.close();
```

When we try and run this, we get this error:

```text
ReferenceError: document is not defined
```

The reason this is happening is because we're trying to run browser-side code on the server-side where it is not supported. [`document`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document) is a property of the browser [**Window**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) instance that holds the rendered website; therefore, this API is not available in Node.js. So how are we supposed to run code within the context of the browser?

## [](#running-in-browser-context) Running code in the context of the browser

We will use `page.evaluate()` to run our code in the browser. This method takes a callback as its first parameter, which will be executed within the browser.

```marked-tabs
<marked-tab header="Playwright" lang="javascript">
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
const page = await browser.newPage();

await page.goto('https://google.com/');

await page.evaluate(() => {
    document.body.style.background = 'green';
});

await page.waitForTimeout(10000)

await browser.close();
</marked-tab>
<marked-tab header="Puppeteer" lang="javascript">
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';

const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: false });
const page = await browser.newPage();

await page.goto('https://google.com/');

await page.evaluate(() => {
    document.body.style.background = 'green';
});

await page.waitForTimeout(10000)

await browser.close();
</marked-tab>
```

Here's what we see in the automated browser when we run this code:

## [](#using-variables-in-page-evaluate) Using variables in `page.evaluate()`

Within our code, we generate a `randomString` in the Node.js context:

```JavaScript
const randomString = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);
```

Now, let's say we want to change the title of the document to be this random string. In order to use this `randomString` variable in the callback of our `page.evaluate()`, we'll have to pass in a second parameter containing the variable.

> It's best practice to make this second parameter an object, as you are usually passing more than one value in.

```marked-tabs
<marked-tab header="Playwright" lang="javascript">
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
const page = await browser.newPage();

await page.goto('https://google.com/');

const randomString = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);

await page.evaluate(({ randomString }) => {
    document.querySelector('title').textContent = randomString;
}, { randomString });

await page.waitForTimeout(10000)

await browser.close();
</marked-tab>
<marked-tab header="Puppeteer" lang="javascript">
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';

const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: false });
const page = await browser.newPage();

await page.goto('https://google.com/');

const randomString = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);

await page.evaluate(({ randomString }) => {
    document.querySelector('title').textContent = randomString;
}, { randomString });

await page.waitForTimeout(10000)

await browser.close();
</marked-tab>
```

Now, when we run this code, we can see the title change on the page's tab:
