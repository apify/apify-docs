# What is JS in HTML?

Depending on the technology the target website is using, the data to be collected not only can be found within HTML elements, but also in a JSON format within `<script>` tags in the DOM.

The advantages of using these objects instead of parsing the HTML are that parsing JSON is much simpler, and more reliable than parsing HTML elements. They are much less likely to change, while the CSS selectors are prone to updates and renamings every time the website is updated.

> **Note:** In this tutorial, we'll be using [SoundCloud's website](https://soundcloud.com) as an example target, but the techniques described here can be applied to any site.

## [](#locating-json-in-html) Locating JSON objects within `<script>` tags

Using our DevTools, we can inspect our [target page](https://soundcloud.com/tiesto/tracks), or right click the page and click **View Page Source** to see the DOM. Next, we'll find a value on the page that we can predict would be in a potential API response. For our page, we'll use the **Tracks** count of `845`. On the **View Page Source** page, we'll do <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> and type in this value, which will show all matches for it within the DOM. This method can expose `<script>` tag objects which hold the target data.

These data objects will usually be attached to the window object (often prefixed with two uderscores - `__`). When scrolling to the beginning of the script tag on our **View Page Source** page, we see that the name of our target object is `__sc_hydration`. Heading back to DevTools and typing this into the console, the object is displayed.

## [](#parsing-objects) Parsing

There are two ways to go about obtaining these objects to be used and manupulated in JavaScript code:

### 1. Parsing them directly from the HTML

```JavaScript
const html = $.html() // same as "document.querySelector('html').innerHTML"

const string = html.split('window.__sc_hydration = ')[1].split(';</script>')[0]

const data = JSON.parse(string)

console.log(data)
```

### 2. Retrieving them within the context of the browser

Tools like [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) allow us to run code within the context in the browser, as well as return things out of these functions and use the data back in the Node.js context.

```JavaScript
const data = await page.evaluate(() => window.__sc_hydration)

console.log(data)
```
