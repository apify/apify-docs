# User-Agent Switcher

**User-Agent Switcher** is a simple Chrome extension that allows you to quickly change your **User-Agent** and see how a certain website would behave with different user agents. After adding it to Chrome, you'll see a **Chrome UA Spoofer** button in  the extension icons area. Clicking on it will open up a list of various **User-Agent** groups.

Clicking on a group will display a list of possible user-agents to set.

After setting the **User-Agent**, the page will be refreshed.

## Configuration

The extension configuration page allows you to edit the **User-Agent** list in case you want to add a specific user-agent that isn't already provided. There are some other options, but most likely you will never need to modify those.
