# Glossary

Web scraping comes with a lot of terms that are specific to the area. Some of them are libraries, like Puppeteer or Playwright. Some are general topics that have a special place in web scraping, like headless browsers or browser fingerprints. And some topics are related to all web development, but play a special role in web scraping, like cookies.

When writing the academy, we realized that we needed to reference those terms, but we quickly found out the usual tutorials and guides available all over the web were not the most ideal. The explanations were too broad and generic, and they did not fit the web scraping context. With the glossary, we aim to provide you with short articles that provide the necessary web scraping context and then link to other parts of the web for further reading.
