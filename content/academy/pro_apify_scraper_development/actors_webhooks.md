# [](#advanced-actors) Advanced actor overview

Thus far, you've run actors on the platform, and written an actor of your own, which you published to the platform yourself using the Apify CLI; therefore, it's fair to say that you are becoming more familiar and comfortable with the concept of **actors**. Within this lesson, we'll take a more in-depth look at actors.

Take another look at the files within your project from the previous lesson. You'll notice that there is a **Dockerfile**. Every single actor has a Dockerfile (the actor's **Image**) which tells Docker how to spin up a container on the Apify platform which can successfully run the actor's code. "Apify Actors" is basically just a serverless platform that is running multiple Docker containers. For a deeper understanding of actor Dockerfiles, refer to the [Apify actor Dockerfile docs](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/guides/docker-images#example-dockerfile).

## [](#learning) Learning üß†

Prior to moving forward, please read over these resources:

- Read about [running actors, handling actor inputs, memory and CPU](https://docs.apify.com/actors/running).
- Learn about [actor webhooks](https://docs.apify.com/webhooks), which we will implement in the next lesson.
- Learn [how to run actors](https://docs.apify.com/tutorials/integrations/run-actor-and-retrieve-data-via-api#run-an-actor-or-task) using Apify's REST API.

## [](#quiz) Knowledge check üìù

1. How do you allocate more CPU for an actor's run?
2. Within itself, can you get the exact time that an actor was started?
3. What are the types of default storages connected to an actor's run?
4. Can you change the allocated memory of an actor while it's running?
5. How can you run an actor with Puppeteer on the Apify platform with headless mode set to `false`?

## [](#our-task) Our task

In this task, we'll be building on top of what we already created in the previous lesson, so keep those files safe!

Once our Amazon actor has completed its run, we will, rather than sending an email to ourselves, call an actor through a webhook. The actor called will be a new actor that we will create together, which will take the dataset ID as input, then subsequently filter through all of the results and return only the cheapest one for each product. All of the results of the actor will be pushed to its default dataset.

## [](#next) Next up

[Next up]({{@link pro_apify_scraper_development/integrating_webhooks.md}}), we'll be building the actor described above, and integrating it with the actor we built last lesson with webhooks (don't worry, on the Apify platform, integrations are a walk in the park!).
