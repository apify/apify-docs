# [](#learning-the-api) Learning the API

Just like when working with regular RESTful APIs in the [**General API scraping**]({{@link api_scraping/general_api_scraping/locating_and_learning.md}}) section, it's important to learn a bit about the different available features of the GraphQL API (or at least of the the query/mutation) you are scraping before actually writing any code.

Not only does becoming comfortable with and understanding the ins and outs of using the API make the development process easier, but it can also sometimes expose features which will return data you'd otherwise be scraping from a different location.

<!-- show the endpoint -->

<!-- literally copy the json payload and test it in postman, oops we need the x-app-token header, add that -->

<!-- explain the query is graphQL language -->

<!-- SHOW HOW TO DO INTROSPECTION (IMPORTANT) -->

<!-- end lesson -->

<!-- IN THE NEXT LESSON: -->

<!-- show how to do it with gotscraping -->

<!-- show the naive soluton: string literals -->
