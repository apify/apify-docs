# [](#type-aliases) Type aliases

Real quick, let's look at this code:

```TypeScript
// Using a union type to allow value to be either a string,
// a number, or a boolean
const returnValueAsString = (value: string | number | boolean) => {
    return `${value}`;
};

let myValue: string | number | boolean;

myValue = 55;

console.log(returnValueAsString(myValue));
```

This is fine, but we had to write `string | number | boolean` twice, and if this were a large project, we'd likely find ourselves writing it even more times. The solution for this is to define the type elsewhere, giving it a name by which it can be identified, then to use that name within the type annotations for `returnValueAsString` and `myValue`.

## [](#creating-types) Creating types

With the `type` keyword, you can abstract all the type stuff you'd normally put in a type annotation into one **type alias**. The great thing about type aliases is that they improve code readability and can be used in multiple places.

First, we'll use the `type` keyword and call the type `MyUnionType`.

```TypeScript
type MyUnionType =
```

Then, we can just copy-paste the union type between a string, number, and boolean and paste it after the equals sign:

```TypeScript
type MyUnionType = string | number | boolean;
```

The type is now stored under this `MyUnionType` **alias**.

> Any type declaration "logic" that you can place within a type annotation can also be stored under a type alias.

## [](#using-type-aliases) Using type aliases

All we need to do to refactor the code from the beginning of the lesson is replace the type annotations with `MyUnionType`:

```TypeScript
type MyUnionType = string | number | boolean;

const returnValueAsString = (value: MyUnionType) => {
    return `${value}`;
};

let myValue: MyUnionType;

myValue = 55;

console.log(returnValueAsString(myValue));
```

## [](#function-types) Function types

Before we learn about how to write function types, let's learn about a problem they can solve. We have a simple function called `addAll` which takes in array of numbers, adds them all up, then returns the result.

```TypeScript
const addAll = (nums: number[]) => {
    return nums.reduce((prev, curr) => prev + curr, 0);
};
```

We want to add the ability to choose whether or not the result should be printed to the console. A function's parameter can be marked as optional by using a question mark.

Let's do that now.

```TypeScript
// We've added a return type to the function because it will return different
// things based on the "printResult" parameter. When false, a number will be
// returned, while when true, nothing will be returned (void).
const addAll = (nums: number[], printResult?: boolean): number | void => {
    const result = nums.reduce((prev, curr) => prev + curr, 0);

    if (!printResult) return result;

    console.log('Result:', result);
};
```

Also, it'd be nice to have some option to pass in a custom message for when the result is logged to the console, so we'll add another optional parameter for that.

```TypeScript
const addAll = (nums: number[], printResult?: boolean, printWithMessage?: string): number | void => {
    const result = nums.reduce((prev, curr) => prev + curr, 0);

    if (!printResult) return result;

    console.log(printWithMessage || 'Result:', result);
};
```

Finally, we'll add a final parameter with the option to return/print the result as a string instead of a number.

```TypeScript
const addAll = (nums: number[], toString?: boolean, printResult?: boolean, printWithMessage?: string): number | string | void => {
    const result = nums.reduce((prev, curr) => prev + curr, 0);

    if (!printResult) return toString ? result.toString() : result;

    console.log(printWithMessage || 'Result:', toString ? result.toString : result);
};
```

What we're left with is a massive function declaration that is very verbose. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but all of these typings could be put into a function type instead.

### [](#creating-and-using-function-types) Creating & using function types

Function types are declared with the `type` keyword (or directly within a type annotation), and are written in a similar fashion to regular arrow functions. All parameters and their types go inside of the parentheses (`()`), and the return type of the function goes after the arrow (`=>`).

```TypeScript
type AddFunction = (numbers: number[], toString?: boolean, printResult?: boolean, printWithMessage?: string) => number | string | void;
```

This is where the true magic happens. Because our arrow function is stored in a variable, and because we've now created the `AddFunction` type, we can delete all type annotations from the function itself and annotate the variable with `AddFunction` instead.

```TypeScript
type AddFunction = (numbers: number[], toString?: boolean, printResult?: boolean, printWithMessage?: string) => number | string | void;

const addAll: AddFunction = (nums, toString, printResult, printWithMessage) => {
    const result = nums.reduce((prev, curr) => prev + curr, 0);

    if (!printResult) return toString ? result.toString() : result;

    console.log(printWithMessage || 'Result:', toString ? result.toString : result);
};
```

We've significantly cleaned up the function by moving its verbose type annotations into a type alias without losing the benefits of TypeScript.

## [](#next) Next up

There is a special type you haven't learned about called `unknown`. We haven't yet discussed it, because it's best learned alongside **type casting**, which is yet another feature offered by TypeScript. Learn all about the `unknown` type and typecasting in the [next lesson]({{@link switching_to_typescript/unknown_and_type_assertions.md}}).
