# [](#interfaces) Interfaces

Interfaces just object types

can extend each other

classes can extend them to add class constraints

## [](#mini-project) Mini-project

1. Make custom interface for API response
2. Case interface type to API response
3. Make custom interface for modified API response (with omitted key with `Omit` + extra custom key using `extends`)
4. Filter the data/modify it somehow
5. Return the data having the new modified response type array
