# [](#enums) Enums!

Enums are an awesome feature offered by TypeScript that can be used to create automatically enumerated global constant identifiers that can also be used as custom types. We've dedicated an entire lesson to enums because they're a new feature brought into JavaScript by TypeScript, and because they can be massively useful in certain projects.
