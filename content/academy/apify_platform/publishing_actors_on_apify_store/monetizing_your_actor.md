# [](#monetizing-your-actor) Monetizing your actor

When publishing your actor on the Apify platform you have the choice to make it a **Paid actor** and get paid by the users benefiting from your tool.

![Paid actor example](https://i.postimg.cc/k5VHybtm/scraper-example.png)

Paid actor users pay a monthly rental fee to use the tool, which is **paid in full to the actor’s developer.** This means that, in the example above, the developer would get the full $45 monthly rent paid by each actor’s user.

## [](#request-monetization) Request monetization

While on your actor settings page, scroll down to the actor’s **Monetization** section and click on **Request Monetization.**

Our support team will be notified about your request and promptly contact you to discuss the price and trial length details for your paid actor.

You will be asked to fill in your billing details. So, if you didn’t do it already, you can go ahead and fill it in by going to **Settings** → **Usage and billing** → **Subscription** → **Billing details**

## [](#price-and-trial-length) **Price and trial length**

**You choose the price and free trial length of your actor.** Apify can give you advice about the best practices of the most successful actors, but at the end of the day, we give developers full control over the pricing strategy of their tools.

## **Where can I keep track of my paid actor’s users and earnings on the Apify Platform?**

Inside the Apify Console, go to **Actors → Earnings.**

Here you have access to a table detailing all the relevant information about your paid actor, including the estimated revenue and number of paying users.

## [](#promote-your-actor) Promote your actor

Your paid actors’ earnings are directly related to the amount of paying users you have for your tool. So, after publishing and monetizing your software, comes a crucial step for your actor’s success: **attracting users**.

Getting new users can be an art in itself, but there are **two simple steps** you can take to ensure your actor is getting the attention it deserves.

1.  **SEO-optimized description and README**

    Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and quantity of traffic from search engines to your actor’s page.

    In short, SEO-optimized texts improve the likelihood that potential customers will find your actor when searching for similar tools on the web.

    This can be a daunting task to take on your own, so we prepared an in-depth [SEO guide](https://docs.apify.com/actors/publishing/seo-and-promotion) to help you **fine-tune your actor’s title, description, and Readme.**

2.  **Promoting your actor**

    Promoting your actor on the right channels can be the deciding factor in successfully attracting users.

    While there are various ways to effectively promote your tool, it is usually best to share it on multiple channels. So, here are a few suggestions of channels you can use to promote your actor:

    - **Reddit and Quora**

    Find subreddits and Quora topics where the audience might be interested in the tool you developed, for example, the subreddit [r/webscraping](https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/). Here you can check an [example](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-use-TikTok-to-market-your-business/answer/Theo-Vasilis?ch=10&oid=352266072&share=42bb7fae&srid=uFNdtn&target_type=answer) of how you can structure your posts on these social media to promote your actor.

    - **Social Media (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn)**

    Don’t underestimate your own network! Your social media connections can be a valuable ally in promoting your actor. Not only can they use your tool to enrich their own professional activities, but also support your work by helping you promote your actor to their network.

    For inspiration, you can check Apify’s [Twitter](https://twitter.com/apify), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/apifytech/), and [LinkedIn](https://cz.linkedin.com/company/apifytech) pages, and **don’t forget to tag Apify on your posts** we will retweet and share your posts to help you reach an even broader audience.

    - **YouTube**

    Videos are a powerful way to promote your actors. Short tutorials showcasing your tool’s features and teaching users how to use them can be an effective way to boost your marketing efforts and provide value to your potential customers.

    For reference, you can check Apify’s [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ0LYBCjvd4&list=PLObrtcm1Kw6PmbXg8bmfJN-o2Hgx8sidf&index=1).

    - **Publish an article about your actor**

    Writing an article about your actor is a great way to attract public attention and gain users.

    You can share your actor’s development journey with other developers, write a tutorial about how to effectively use the tool you created, or visit [Apify Blog](https://blog.apify.com/) for more ideas about how to promote your actors. For inspiration, you can check this [How to Scrape Google Shopping](https://blog.apify.com/how-to-scrape-google-shopping/) tutorial on our blog.

    Once your article is ready, you can check this list of relevant websites where you can publish your article: [hackernoon.com](https://hackernoon.com/), [techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/), [news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/), [dev.to](https://dev.to/), [producthunt.com,](https://www.producthunt.com/) [indiehackers.com](https://www.indiehackers.com/)

**Don’t overlook promoting your actor**. This is arguably the most important step after publishing your tool. Taking advantage of all the possible mediums for promotion is what often differentiates very successful actors with dozens of paid users from actors with few to no users at all.
