# [](#publishing-actor) Publishing your actor

Before you make your actor public, it is important to write a good **Description** and **README** sections, so that users can understand what your actor does, how to configure its inputs, and what kind of output it returns.

You can find the Title and description configurations by going to **Apify Console** → **Actors** → **My Actors** → **your-actor** → **Settings → Publication**

By optimizing your actor’s description and README for SEO, you can significantly increase the traffic of users to your actor’s page and, consequently, improve your chances of getting more users.

We know this can be a daunting task to take on your own, so we prepared an in-depth [SEO guide](https://docs.apify.com/actors/publishing/seo-and-promotion) to help you **fine-tune your actor’s title, description, and Readme.**

Now, let’s move on to understand exactly how to add a description and README to your Apify actors.

## [](#description) Description

The actor’s description is a short paragraph describing the actor’s purpose. It will be displayed on the actor’s page right below its title.

While writing your actor’s description you also have the option to write an SEO title and description. The SEO title and description are used in place of the actor name and description on search engine results pages. Good SEO titles and descriptions utilize popular keywords, summarize the actor functionality, and are between 40-50 and 140-156 characters long, respectively.

## [](#readme) README

The next step is to write a **README** detailing the actor’s features, reasons to scrape the targeted website, and an explanation about how to use the actor.

Keep in mind that the actor’s README is generated from your README.md file, and you can apply the same [SEO principles](https://docs.apify.com/actors/publishing/seo-and-promotion) throughout the README.

To save some time when writing an actor’s README, we recommend using the template below as a starting point:

Note that the complexity of the README should match the actor’s complexity. This means that the template above is not immutable and that you can adapt it to fit the particularities of your actor. You can check our guide, \***\*[How to write great README for your actors](https://help.apify.com/en/articles/2912548-how-to-write-great-readme-for-your-actors)\*\***, for more examples of README files.

## [](#make-your-actor-public) Make your actor Public

Once you have finished coding and testing your actor, it's time to publish it.

From your actor’s page in Apify Console, go to **Settings,** and \***\*scroll down to the **Public Information\*\* section.

Select the **Published** switch, and your actor should now be available to the public on Apify Store.

To check if everything went smoothly, you can go to [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store) and search for your actor’s name.

Then, click on your actor’s card and you will see your dedicated actor’s page. This is the page where users will most likely have their first contact with your actor, so make sure to carefully review it and check if everything is set up correctly.
