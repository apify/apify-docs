# Advanced web scraping

In [**Web scraping for beginners**]({{@link web_scraping_for_beginners.md}}) course, we have learned the nesesary basics required to create a scraper. In the following courses, we enhanced our scraping toolbox by scraping APIs, using browsers, scraping dynamic websites, understanding website anti-scraping protection and making our code more maintainable by moving into Typescript. 

In this course, we will take all of that knowledge, add a few more advanced concepts and apply them to learn how to build a production-ready web scraper.

## [](#what-does-production-ready-mean) What does production-ready mean?

Of course, there is no single world-wide definition of what production-ready system is. Different companies and use-cases will place different priorities on the project. But in general, a production-ready system is stable, reliable, scalable, performant, observable and maintainable.

The following sections will cover the core concepts that will ensure that your scraper is production-ready:
- Advanced crawling section will cover how to ensure we find all pages or products on the website.
- The advanced data extraction will cover how to efficiently extact data from particular page or API.

Both of these section will include guides for monitoring, performance, anti-scraping protections and debugging.

If you've managed to follow along with all of the courses prior to this one, then you're more than ready to take these upcoming lessons on ðŸ˜Ž
