# Advanced web scraping

Welcome to the **Advanced web scraping** course where you will learn all the tricks professional web scraping developers use to collect data from any website fast, efficiently, and reliably. If you're new to web scraping, you might want to check out the [Web scraping for beginners course]({{@link web_scraping_for_beginners.md}}) first. It will help you understand web scraping as a concept and will teach you how to analyze websites and build your own scraper.

## [](#summary) Course summary

When we set out to create the Academy, we wanted to build a complete guide to modern web scraping. A course that a beginner could use to create their first scraper, as well as a resource that professionals will continuously use to learn about advanced and niche web scraping techniques. All lessons include code examples and code-along exercises that you can use to immediately put your scraping skills into action.

This is what you'll learn in the **Web scraping for beginners** course:

* [Advanced web scraping]({{@link advanced_web_scraping.md}})
  * [API scraping]({{@link advanced_web_scraping/advanced_data_collection/api_scraping.md}})
  * [Data in JavaScript objects]({{@link advanced_web_scraping/advanced_data_collection/js_in_html.md}})
  * [Dealing with dynamic dontent]({{@link advanced_web_scraping/advanced_data_collection/js_rendering_and_dynamic_pages.md}})

## [](#requirements) Requirements

You don't need to be a professional programmer to follow this course. However, unlike the [Web scraping for beginners course]({{@link web_scraping_for_beginners.md}}), this course does not go into a lot of detail on programming topics, DevTools and other concepts most developers would already know. It gets straight to the point of collecting data. If you feel overwhelmed at any point, we suggest you [try the beginner]({{@link web_scraping_for_beginners.md}}) course first, or refresh your knowledge.

## [](#next) Next up

The course gets straight to the point with one of the most important topics in web scraping: [API scraping]({{@link advanced_web_scraping/advanced_data_collection/api_scraping.md}}).
