When publishing your actor on the Apify platform you have the choice to make it a **Paid actor** and get paid by the users benefiting from your tool.

Paid actor users pay a monthly rental fee to use the tool, which is **paid in full to the actor’s developer.** This means that, in the example above, the developer would get the full $45 monthly rent paid by each actor’s user.

First, go to your actor page, **Actors → My Actors** and click on the actor you want to monetize. While on your actor page, go to the **Publication** tab on the right side of the screen and click on the **Request Monetization** button, located under the **Monetization** section.

### Where can I keep track of my paid actor’s users and earnings on the Apify Platform?

## [](#promote-your-actor) Promote your actor

Your paid actors’ earnings are directly related to the amount of paying users you have for your tool. So, after publishing and monetizing your software, comes a crucial step for your actor’s success: **attracting users**.

Getting new users can be an art in itself, but there are **two simple steps** you can take to ensure your actor is getting the attention it deserves.

1. **SEO-optimized description and README**

    Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and quantity of traffic from search engines to your actor’s page.

    In short, SEO-optimized texts improve the likelihood that potential customers will find your actor when searching for similar tools on the web.

    This can be a daunting task to take on your own, so we prepared an in-depth [SEO guide]{{@link get_most_of_actors/seo_and_promotion.md}} to help you **fine-tune your actor’s title, description, and Readme.**

2. **Promoting your actor**

    Promoting your actor on the right channels can be the deciding factor in successfully attracting users.

    While there are various ways to effectively promote your tool, it is usually best to share it on multiple channels. So, here are a few suggestions of channels you can use to promote your actor:

    - **Reddit and Quora**

    Find subreddits and Quora topics where the audience might be interested in the tool you developed, for example, the subreddit [r/webscraping](https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/). Here you can check an [example](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-use-TikTok-to-market-your-business/answer/Theo-Vasilis?ch=10&oid=352266072&share=42bb7fae&srid=uFNdtn&target_type=answer) of how you can structure your posts on these social media to promote your actor.

    - **Social Media (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn)**

    Don’t underestimate your own network! Your social media connections can be a valuable ally in promoting your actor. Not only can they use your tool to enrich their own professional activities, but also support your work by helping you promote your actor to their network.

    For inspiration, you can check Apify’s [Twitter](https://twitter.com/apify), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/apifytech/), and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/company/apifytech) pages, and **don’t forget to tag Apify on your posts** we will retweet and share your posts to help you reach an even broader audience.

    - **YouTube**

    Videos are a powerful way to promote your actors. Short tutorials showcasing your tool’s features and teaching users how to use them can be an effective way to boost your marketing efforts and provide value to your potential customers.

    - **Publish an article about your actor**

    Writing an article about your actor is a great way to attract public attention and gain users.
